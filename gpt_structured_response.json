    "explanation": "There is significant discussion around BTC with both bullish and bearish opinions. Several users mention breakout, supply zone, and that BTC could go to 108500 or even higher, suggesting positive sentiment. Multiple users recommend buying or holding BTC, and several mention technical analysis cues such as breaking resistance and consolidation. However, there are still many calling for caution or short positions, indicating mixed market sentiment. The overall bias in the last 1-minute candlesticks is slightly bullish, but not with overwhelming confidence due to visible bearish and neutral commentary.",
