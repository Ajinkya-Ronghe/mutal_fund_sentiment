    "explanation": "Despite a few negative or neutral opinions, the majority of live chat comments indicate bullish sentiment for BTC. Multiple users mention targets above 109k, 112k, and even 118k, with consistent calls for new all-time highs (ATH). Many are discussing profit-booking at higher levels, and several mention re-entering or holding longs. Some caution around news events (e.g., Powell's speech), but there is no strong consensus for a sustained downside. Volume is described as strong, and FOMO (fear of missing out) is apparent. Even when mentioning potential dips, participants frame them as buying opportunities. Representative opinions cover both technical and emotional aspects, supporting a strong buy signal with high confidence.",
