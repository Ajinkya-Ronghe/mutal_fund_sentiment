    "explanation": "Despite a highly mixed sentiment and short-term volatility, the majority of high-confidence and experienced voices are suggesting that BTC is in a bullish cycle, with several noting accumulation on dips, an incoming boom, or a return to all-time highs. Counter-narratives exist (calls for shorting, warning of bull traps or liquidity grabs), but the weight of opinion is on the side of buying for spot and longer-term holds, and even intraday traders are seeking long opportunities. Evidence of large buys and whale activity, macro support from Powell's comments, and technical signals (inverted H&S, bull flags, liquidity grabs before a move up) reinforce the conviction for a long bias. The primary risk is sharp stop loss triggers and whipsawing, but these are seen as opportunities for disciplined entries rather than reasons to avoid the market.",
