    "explanation": "The live chat provided a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment for BTC. Several users called for buying and entry (e.g. 'buy', 'one minutes 4u: buy btc', 'Mohit Prajapati âï¸: BHAI BTC ME ENTRY KER LE KYAA'), and some mentioned breakout or uptrend signals. However, there is also mention of resistance zones, supply zones, and short-term bearish indicators (e.g. 'MonuDada: bro 4H candle is red', 'Return on Investment: short it', 'abdul aziz: btc 107434 si selling hi'). The positive momentum is slightly stronger in the short-term, but overall sentiment is mixed. Therefore, the confidence is 'medium'. Recommended leverage is low due to volatility and mixed views.",
