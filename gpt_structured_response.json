    "explanation": "The majority of recent live opinions highlight downside risk for BTC, with multiple mentions of bearish patterns (e.g., bearish flag, channel breakdown, trendline breaks, and liquidity hunts). Many traders report stop-losses being hit on long positions, calls to short, and warnings of further downside, with some seeing support only at lower levels. However, there are a few scattered bullish comments and neutral stances, reflecting market indecision and volatility, hence the confidence is medium.",
