Comments such as 'DO NOT LONG RIGHT NOW', 'the upside to a long is little', and 'when hasn't bitcoin punished a long the last few days' point to a perceived risk for long positions. Some see minor upside but warn of potential for fakeouts and liquidation, suggesting the market may be trapping longs and could move down before any recovery.",
