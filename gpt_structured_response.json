    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions reflect strong bullish momentum for BTC, referencing breakouts above major resistance levels (108k), market-wide FOMO, and sustained uptrends. Multiple users cite BTC 'flying', 'pumping', and rapidly reclaiming higher price ranges. There are frequent buy-side calls, mentions of profits from long positions, and expectations for BTC to reach new all-time highs soon. Some caution exists around local resistance and short-term retracements, but the prevailing consensus signals continued strength. Community sentiment is reinforced by comments on big resistance being broken, institutional interest, and traders discussing leverage (20x is referenced as a safe level). Negative or neutral comments are minimal and largely drowned out by the bullish narrative.",
