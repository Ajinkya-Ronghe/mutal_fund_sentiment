    "explanation": "Opinions are divided with some calling for potential key support bounces (e.g., 106,400 and 104,400), but overall sentiment in the recent comments leans bearish: mentions of sharp drops, 'the crash,' 'downtrend starting,' and a lack of bullish conviction. There is also talk of major resistance at 108k, and several users discuss heavy sell volume and key levels to watch for further downside. However, a few comments note possible rebounds and the demand zone, so confidence is medium and not high.",
