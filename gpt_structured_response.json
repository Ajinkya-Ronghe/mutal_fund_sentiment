    "explanation": "Multiple participants noted strong bullish momentum in BTC, including breaking through key resistance levels (e.g., 108k) and expectations of reaching new all-time highs. Live trade signals indicate a 'long' entry with defined targets and stop-loss. Despite some bearish short-term opinions and liquidations, the general sentiment is dominated by FOMO buying, bullish technicals, and institutional interest. Furthermore, BTC is described as outperforming alts, and multiple users are seeking buy entries or are holding profitable long positions. The majority see any dips as buying opportunities and expect further upside.",
