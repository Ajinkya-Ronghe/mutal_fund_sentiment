    "explanation": "Multiple participants note BTC's ongoing dominance and bullish structure, with repeated calls for buying dips and remarks that BTC remains 'cheap' relative to potential market cap. Many mention holding or entering long with high targets, referencing strong buying pressure, trendline support, and bullish reversals after liquidity grabs. Short-term signals on the 1-minute and higher timeframes are skewed toward long, with many users reporting successful buy trades and holding for targets up to 110k. Discussions about BTC's long-term value, dominance, and FOMO all support a strong bullish sentiment.",
