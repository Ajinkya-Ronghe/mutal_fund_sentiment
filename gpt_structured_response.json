    "explanation": "Multiple participants noted recent rejection at trend lines and resistance, with opinions mentioning a trap for longs and warnings against longing before a retracement. Candlestick signals on the 1-minute timeframe were described as showing rejection and potential traps, and several traders advocate waiting for a drop or shorting. However, there is some bullish sentiment about higher timeframes and possible upside targets, so confidence is only medium.",
