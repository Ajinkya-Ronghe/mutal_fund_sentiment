    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed but slightly skewed toward bullishness: regular buyers (e.g., weekly DCA) and several comments about buying and market support. Some warn about possible downside risks (war/news, bears roaming, short calls), but the presence of ongoing buyers, support at 107210, and people 'buying all the BTC' support a moderate buy signal. No consensus on strong trend, but no major panic or mass selling observed.",
