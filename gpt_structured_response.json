    "explanation": "Several participants forecast higher BTC targets (109k, 120k), mention of an ascending triangle (bullish continuation), and calls to 'hodl' and expect momentum to build for a breakout. While there are some bearish/sideways opinions (calls for 90k, 103k, sideways until more momentum), the overall tone from the majority is bullish. No technical short signals or strong sell consensus were present. The consensus is more optimistic than negative, but not unanimous, so confidence is medium.",
