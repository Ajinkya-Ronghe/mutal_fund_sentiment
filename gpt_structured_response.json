    "explanation": "BTC remains the dominant discussion among traders and is seen as the most reliable investment compared to alternatives. Multiple comments highlight BTC as an asset that 'beats everything else', is still 'very early', and has 'bullish news in macro sense'. Many traders report strong profits or life-changing gains from holding BTC, and there is persistent encouragement to ignore FUD and hold or buy the dip. Despite some debate about short-term volatility, the majority of opinions reflect ongoing optimism, resilience, and recommendations to enter long or hold positions. Common questions about where to buy, how much leverage to use, and when to enter suggest high current engagement and interest in accumulating more BTC. Calls for using isolated leverage, buy signals, and positive funding rates further reinforce a bullish bias.",
