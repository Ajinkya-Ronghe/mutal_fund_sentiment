    "explanation": "There is a strong bullish sentiment on BTC with multiple users calling for pumps above key resistance levels (107,200, 106,600, 108,000, 109k). Users refer to positive macro factors (tech stocks in green, new ATH for NAS100 pre-market, bullish stochastics on multiple timeframes). Some mention holding above 119k as an extremely bullish outcome, and the overall discussion is dominated by anticipation of new highs, with only a few voices suggesting short-term pullbacks or dips. There is minimal negative sentiment and several confirmations of uptrend, making this a high-confidence buy signal on BTC for the next move.",
