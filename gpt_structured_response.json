    "confidence": "medium",
    "explanation": "The overall sentiment is mixed but tilts bullish: there are several mentions of BTC defending key moving averages (like the 50 MA), high 1-minute volume, and suggestions for buying at lower levels. Technical patterns like the inverse head and shoulders, ascending triangle, and flag pattern are cited by some as bullish signals. Some traders expect a pullback before the next upward move, while others reference accumulation by institutional players and dominance of BTC over alts. However, there are also warnings of sideways or range-bound action, and a few expect dumps or reversals, so confidence is medium rather than high.",
