    "explanation": "Despite short-term volatility and some bearish voices, the overall sentiment in the live chat is skewed bullish for BTC. Many users are discussing liquidity zones, demand and supply blocks, and significant buying interest around 107k-109k levels. Multiple users seek buy entries, mention missed buying opportunities, and ask for confirmation to add more quantity. There is also notable excitement about possible upside moves, a 'boom' signal, and confirmation from several users that the trend is up on various timeframes. The candlestick and momentum-based comments (15m, 1hr, 4hr bullish crossover, 'buy soon will fly', 'BTC samaj ke fire samja ye wild fire huva') further support the long bias. Few negative comments are not representative and appear more like typical short-term retracement or profit-booking talk. There is no strong fundamental news against BTC, and risk appetite remains high, with some users discussing high leverage and isolated margin trading.",

What's important now is: if it breaks through and consolidates below this zone, it will most likely fly further - all the way to 106900 / 106400, there are good demand blocks and volumes there.",
