    "explanation": "Opinion flow is mixed but skews negative in the immediate term: multiple users call for down moves, mention selling pressure, and reference failed support levels, while others discuss failed short entries and liquidity sweeps. Concerns about liquidity, short entries, and bearish technicals (e.g., bear flags, lower highs, exhaustion after pumps) are prevalent. A handful of bullish or recovery mentions exist, but the short-term consensus is a relief drop or further downside. However, strong long-term bullish sentiment and FOMO potential are present, so confidence is only medium.",
