    "explanation": "The majority of opinions reflect bullish sentiment or expectations of upward movement for BTC, referencing specific price targets (108k, 108500, 109k, 110k, 112k, 120k), breakout expectations, all-time high discussions, and several recommendations to buy or hold. There are also multiple mentions of support zones, pullbacks before long entries, and positive momentum. Negative or neutral comments exist but are outweighed by the strong number of participants expecting further upside, as well as calls to 'go long', 'never look back', and 'BTC flying'.",
