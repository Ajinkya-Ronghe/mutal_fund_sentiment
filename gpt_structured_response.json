    "explanation": "The sentiment from the live chat is mixed, but there is a notable increase in negative momentum and warnings of a downtrend. Several users mention key support levels being broken (e.g., $106,500), expectations for a further fall to $104,000, and references to 'crash', 'dump', and large sell volumes at resistance (108k). Some bullish comments exist, such as mentions of 'recovery', but the majority of actionable trading talk skews bearish for the immediate term. There are also direct questions about whether to buy or sell, showing indecision, but more representative opinions are worried about downside or suggest closing longs. No clear high-confidence bullish entries are visible, and the 1-minute sentiment is short-term negative.",
