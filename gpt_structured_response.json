Some are waiting for further dips (105k or lower), and a few are considering shorting if BTC reaches 108.2k. However, there are also bullish voices expecting higher prices if the dollar crashes or large players intervene. The overall tone is cautious with a slight bearish tilt for the immediate term.",
