    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed, but there is a slight bullish sentiment supported by targets above 108k and 111k, suggestions to buy on dips, and technical discussions about long setups. However, there are also notable warnings about sideways action, potential rejections, and some traders advocating for shorts or expressing caution. The 1-minute chart is referenced in live chat updates, but no clear consensus of extreme bullishness. Safe, isolated low leverage is recommended due to the mixed views and potential for volatility.",
