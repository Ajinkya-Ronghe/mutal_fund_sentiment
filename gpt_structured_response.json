    "explanation": "There is a clear division in the opinions, but several traders mention support holds, bullish trendline retests, recommendations to take buy-side trades, and expectations of upward movement towards 108,000â110,000. The 1-minute candlestick signal is mixed, with some calling for immediate entries and others warning of volatility and potential retracements. The overall bias is slightly bullish, but with high volatility and risk of reversals.",
