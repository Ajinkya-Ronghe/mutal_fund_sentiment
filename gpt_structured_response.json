    "explanation": "Recent comments indicate BTC broke out above 108.4k but quickly fell back below 108k, with sentiment shifting from excitement to concern. Some users mention 'smart money selling' and 'party 108k is over,' while others reference holding positions or calling for a buy at the dip. Technical comments suggest 107k is a strong support, but the overall tone is cautious after the failed breakout. The presence of both bullish and bearish opinions, as well as advice on using stop losses and being careful with leverage, produces a medium confidence short-term sell signal.",
