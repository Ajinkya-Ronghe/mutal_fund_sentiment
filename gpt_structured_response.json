    "explanation": "The majority of opinions are leaning bearish or cautious for BTC in the short term. Multiple users mention upcoming dumps or downside (e.g., '15 minutes mai dump ayega', 'btc short entry', 'heavy liquidity downside'), and key levels (e.g., 107800, 106000, 105000, 103000) are cited as possible next targets for further downside. Several users mention support at 105,000â106,000 and expect a retest or breakdown before any sustainable up move. Some voices highlight fake breakouts and suggest waiting for confirmation. Bullish opinions exist but are outnumbered by warnings of a correction, chop, or urge to wait for a daily close before new longs. The 1-minute candlestick sentiment aligns with a short-term short bias, and caution is advised on leverage due to market volatility.",
