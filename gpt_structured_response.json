    "explanation": "Multiple live chat participants express bullish price expectations for BTC, referencing targets above 107k-109k, mentioning 'big pump coming', 'rocket is fueling up', and 'buy time'. Some discuss technical setups supporting further upside (bull flag, daily close above key levels), and there's notable sentiment expecting higher prices or a continuation of the bull move. A handful of opinions express caution, but positive/bullish statements are dominant. No strong short calls are visible in the sentiment flow.",
