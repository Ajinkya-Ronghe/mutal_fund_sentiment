    "explanation": "Multiple users referenced support at key levels (106,000â109,000), discussed recent breakouts on higher timeframes, and noted large institutional interest and news narratives about massive investments into BTC. Despite volatility and some short calls, there is a prevailing sentiment for a possible bullish move if current resistance is broken, with several mentions of trend continuation on 4hr and 1hr charts. However, some caution is warranted due to ongoing high volatility, profit-taking, and mixed day trading results.",
