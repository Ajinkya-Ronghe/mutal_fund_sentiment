    "explanation": "Majority of opinions are bullish for BTC, with repeated calls for going long, breaking new resistance levels, mentions of strong upside momentum, and an overall sentiment that BTC is heading higher. Many users celebrated passing 108k and discussed targets of 110k, 112k and even higher. There is significant FOMO, and several comments mention strong hands holding and low inflows to exchanges, indicating less selling pressure. While a few short/neutral/bearish comments exist, the overall tone is strongly bullish. Multiple users also ask about safe leverage for BTC, with recommendations up to 25x, but most commonly 20x is cited as safe. The market shows strong momentum candles and celebration around new highs.",
