    "explanation": "The live opinions are notably split but contain more negative or cautionary signals for BTC. While some encourage buying or claim profits (e.g., 'UP UP AND AWAY', 'I just bought a McDonalds today with my profits'), there are frequent references to impending dumps, short recommendations, and forecasted lower prices (e.g., 'preweekend flash dump coming yooo', 'we have to diverge hardcore now. sell, sell, sell!', price forecasts toward 104k, 97k, and calls for shorting). There is no strong technical consensus, but the weight of sentiment leans short-term bearish.",
