    "explanation": "The majority of opinions and trade signals suggest a bullish outlook for BTC, with several mentions of price targets above current levels (108400, 111400, 112000, 114000), system-based discipline to wait for long entries, and algorithmic/AI calls for long with specific entry and take profit points. However, there are also notable short/sideways calls and concerns about volume/resistance, so confidence is not high but remains medium. Leverage should be kept low and isolated due to market volatility and mixed sentiment.",
