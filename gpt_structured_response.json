    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is cautiously optimistic with several mentions of recovery after drops, upcoming institutional accumulation (White House), and expectations for volatility and potential upside. There are warnings of weak momentum, sideways action, and bear flag patterns, but overall more positive than negative suggestions, especially around accumulation plans, price recovering, and buy-side liquidity. The presence of sideways and choppy price action, along with profit-taking and risk management (SL hits, waiting for daily closes), lowers confidence from high to medium. Leverage should be kept low due to expected volatility and possible traps.",
