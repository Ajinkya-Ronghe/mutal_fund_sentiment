    "explanation": "Across a wide range of opinions, BTC sentiment is mixed but leans bullish with repeated mentions of holding through pullbacks, targeting new all-time highs, and strong macro tailwinds. Many traders discussed waiting for liquidity sweeps and retests before a major move up, with several referencing entries and targets above 108k-110k. Macro factors such as dropping bond yields, increasing M2 liquidity, and expectations of rate cuts further support a bullish stance. There is some short-term uncertainty and hesitation, but the overall market seems to expect upside continuation after possible minor dips or consolidations.",
