    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is mixed, with some expressing caution and mentioning resistance levels, possible downside, and risk in both long and short entries. However, several opinionsâespecially from Marticlues AI and traders referencing levels above 107700âsuggest a bullish bias with specific long trade plans and targets up to 112k-114k. There are also mentions of potential short squeezes and higher highs in the near term. The signal is 'Buy' but confidence is only medium due to significant opposing views and market uncertainty.",
