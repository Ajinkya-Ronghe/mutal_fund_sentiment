    "explanation": "The sentiment is mixed, but notable caution is expressed about large sell volumes at resistance, potential for further downside, and a recent significant value drop. Some users mention strong seller control and anticipate further declines (e.g., to 105k or even 104k). There are also many warnings about liquidation risk and overleveraged positions. While some mention possible recoveries and the need for patience, the prevailing short-term sentiment leans bearish with high volatility expected.",
