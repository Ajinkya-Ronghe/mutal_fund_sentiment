    "explanation": "The majority of opinions referencing BTC highlight short-term caution, mentioning resistance levels being respected on the 1-minute chart and recommendations to take profit or consider shorting. Although some bullish comments exist (e.g., ETF buying, 'instant reward for bulls'), the technical focus on a 1-minute close below resistance, talk of placing stop losses, and suggestions to short for a move to support at 107230â107290 point toward a short-term bearish signal. There is no strong consensus for a longer-term move, and sentiment is somewhat mixed, but the technical short-term signals are more prominent in the discussion.",
