Some users report recent profits and expect further upside to 108500/110k. There are also algorithmic signals and some trading bots suggesting long trades near 107442.7, with target prices above current levels. However, there are also a significant number of users mentioning supply zones, order blocks around 107600, and some short calls, indicating that while the bias is upward, the confidence isn't high.",
