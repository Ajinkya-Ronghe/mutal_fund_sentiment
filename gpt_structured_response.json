    "explanation": "Consensus from the live opinions points to bullish momentum for BTC. Multiple users report entering long trades, discussing targets above current levels (e.g., 108,500, 109,000), and referencing strong support and pump potential. There's mention of institutional accumulation, positive news from major asset managers like Fidelity, and a broad shift from altcoins to BTC for the next run up. Several users ask about safe leverage for BTC, and signals suggest a focus on upward price action following macroeconomic events (e.g., Powell's speech). While some warn of short-term pullbacks, the dominant sentiment is positive, reinforced by confirmations of active BTC trades and targets above 108k. No strong negative or neutral clusters are present.",
