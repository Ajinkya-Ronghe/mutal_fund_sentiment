    "explanation": "Multiple participants are referencing bullish targets above current levels (109k, 111k, 113k, 115k, 118k) and discussing strong bullish momentum on higher timeframes (H4, 1H). There are repeated mentions of holding long positions, buying on dips, and capturing upward moves, with several also referencing technical indicators (RSI bounce, EMA alignments, market structure) that support the case for upward continuation. While some mention possible pullbacks and short-term liquidations near resistance, the dominant sentiment is for upward movement and 'buy the dip' mentality, especially with large transfers and bullish volume being noted. Negative opinions (shorts, pullback warnings) are present but clearly outnumbered by bullish and neutral-to-bullish comments. The recommendation is to consider isolated perpetual futures with a safe leverage up to 20x, with appropriate risk management, due to the high volatility and occasional pullbacks flagged by some community members.",
