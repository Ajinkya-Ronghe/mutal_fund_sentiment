    "explanation": "BTC is showing strong resilience despite retail traders opening more shorts, indicating a potential squeeze upward. Multiple users reported holding long positions from lower levels (e.g., 100k) and are trailing stop losses, with targets in the 108k-109k region. Several technical analyses highlighted order blocks around 108,642 and bullish weekly candle closes, suggesting continuation. While some short-term traders are entering shorts or expressing caution about overbought RSI, the dominant sentiment is for upward momentum, especially given ETF inflows and BTC's outperformance over other assets in the last 24 hours. Safe, isolated leverage is recommended due to volatility and mixed retail behavior.",
