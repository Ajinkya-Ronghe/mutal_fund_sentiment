    "explanation": "Despite a mix of bearish and bullish short-term sentiment, several participants highlight BTC's resilience at key support levels, entry signals around 107,000, and breakout potential above 108,500 and 110,000. The presence of large sell volume and short liquidations has not prevented new long recommendations, and market experts expect a 'launch' towards all-time highs if volume returns. BTC dominance remains high while altcoins lag, indicating continued BTC strength.",
