    "explanation": "Despite a mix of sideways and bearish short-term comments, the overall sentiment in the chat is bullish on BTC. Many users mention strong upward moves, key support holds, and expectations for higher targets (e.g., 108900, 109100, 123k). There are repeated calls to 'long' and buy, and several confirmations of strong bounces and price action. Some caution about local resistance or short-term corrections, but the prevailing opinion is to buy or hold, especially with high leverage in perpetual futures. This is reflected by direct user calls to buy, long, and optimism about upcoming highs.",
