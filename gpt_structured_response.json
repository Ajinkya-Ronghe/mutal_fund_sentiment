    "explanation": "Despite some mixed short-term opinions and recent volatility, the consensus in the live chat is that BTC is at or near critical decision levels with many expecting a bounce from major support zones (106500â107000). Several participants mention strong bullish momentum on higher time frames, significant liquidity above, bullish technical patterns (hammer candles, potential for further upside), and large investors being active. Automated trade signals also show a 'Buy Storm' for BTC/USDT at current levels. While some are shorting or expecting dips, the majority either hold, seek to buy on dips, or are looking for long opportunities, especially with isolated, high-leverage perpetuals. Risk management is still vital given the occasional sharp moves and news-driven volatility.",
