    "explanation": "Live opinions show mixed but increasingly bearish short-term sentiment: multiple users discuss shorting from 108k, closing longs, expecting further drops (targets 104k/106k), and heavy resistance and sell walls around 108-109k. Some mention dominance rising as BTC price drops, and order block/fake breakouts causing uncertainty. However, there are also bullish and neutral outlooks, and long-term optimism remains, so confidence is not high.",
