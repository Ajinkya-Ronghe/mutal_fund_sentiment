    "explanation": "There is a noticeable bullish sentiment in the live chat, with multiple users referencing buy signals, upward momentum, W patterns, and 'rocket' or 'up' movement for BTC. Several remarked on bullish candles, support tests, and the possibility of breakouts if certain resistance levels are cleared (e.g., above 107600). However, mixed with this are warnings about fake breakouts, supply zones near 107500/108000, significant liquidations below 105k, and some participants expressing uncertainty or taking short positions. The overall tone is moderately optimistic for BTC upside, but not with strong conviction.",
