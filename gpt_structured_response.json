    "explanation": "A significant number of opinions suggest downside movement, including explicit mentions of 'sell', targets below current prices (e.g., 104000, 106000, 101k, 99999), calls for shorting, and mentions of bear flag, double top, and resistance. While there are some bullish views (breakout, uptrend, potential bounce, and 'buy' calls), the majority of actionable and target-specific comments lean bearish for the short-term. The market sentiment appears cautious with a bias to the downside, especially given the recent price action and comments about trapping bulls, low volume, and possible further corrections.",
