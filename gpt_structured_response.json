    "explanation": "Despite mixed opinions about short-term volatility, there is overwhelming bullish sentiment and repeated confirmations of new highs and strong upward movement. Multiple users note short squeezes, strong liquidity at higher levels, and bullish macro factors like anticipated US rate cuts and increased demand. While some mention possible retracements or traps, the consensus is for further upside, especially with references to 'rocket', 'new high coming soon', and 'bullflag confirmed'. Several users seek buy entries, ask for targets, or confirm holding long positions. Representative quotes include calls for 108k, 109k, and even 113k as next targets, and repeated excitement over 'pump', 'bullish', and 'new high'. The few negative and neutral opinions are greatly outnumbered by positive ones.",
