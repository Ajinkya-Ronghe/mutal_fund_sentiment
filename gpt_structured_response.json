    "explanation": "There is a significant split in sentiment with many users mentioning heavy sell walls, recent profit booking, and closing of longs at resistance levels like 108kâ109k, as well as mentions of sell orders being executed. Several comments indicate traders are expecting a drop or advocating for exits at current levels, despite some bullish macro opinions for the long term. The 1-minute sentiment leans cautiously short due to immediate resistance and profit-taking, even though some users mention longer-term bullishness.",
