    "explanation": "The overall sentiment from the live chat is mixed, but there is a notable increase in bearish warnings. Several participants mention an impending crash, a bull trap, or urge caution with longs. Some expect a price drop to the 108,000â109,000 USD region, and there are explicit short signals for WBTC (wrapped BTC) from Marticlues AI. However, a minority maintain bullish long-term targets (e.g., 200k by Christmas). Given the short-term warnings and explicit short candlestick signals, the recommendation is to Sell/Short with medium confidence for the near term, especially on the 1-minute timeframe.",
