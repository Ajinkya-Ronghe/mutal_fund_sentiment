    "explanation": "The majority of actionable opinions suggest weak momentum, potential for a sharp drop, and difficulty sustaining higher levels. While there are bullish outliers and some humor/enthusiasm (e.g., $1m, 'fly soon', etc.), the balance of specific, actionable statements leans towards caution or short-term downside. Several users mention levels like 107700-108000 as strong resistance or shorting points, and others highlight general weakness or a 'calm before the storm.' Only a few users suggest long-term bullishness or buying now, but these are less specific and more speculative.",
