    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest a high volatility environment with both bullish and bearish intraday views. There is strong mention of buy signals, potential for a bounce from support, a possible big pump, and expectations for higher levels (various targets above 107-108k and even 112k-122k). However, there are also clear short-term warnings and mixed signals about liquidity and short-term downside risks (bear flag, exhaustion, market absorption, expectations for a dip). Overall, the market sentiment is leaning bullish in the short-term, especially around key support levels, but with notable caution due to conflicting signals and rapid fluctuations.",
