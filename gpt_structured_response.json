    "explanation": "Several opinions indicate selling pressure and short-term bearishness for BTC. Comments such as 'Smart money selling moonboy buying', 'BTC just bleed a little more and then do what you like', and suggestions of a possible drop if a certain price isn't held reflect a cautious to bearish sentiment. While there are individual calls to 'BUY!', these are countered by more negative or warning-oriented remarks. No strong consensus on a bullish reversal is present.",
