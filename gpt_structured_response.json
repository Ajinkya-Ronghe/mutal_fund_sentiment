    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "The majority of live opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment for BTC, supported by technical signals (multiple green candles, higher highs, bullish patterns), mentions of key support levels holding, and several calls for long entries. There is consensus on a likely upward movement with multiple participants explicitly stating to go long or highlighting upcoming pumps, and even specific trade signals for long positions (e.g., BTC/USDT: Breakout Jam!). While some mention shorting or possible downside, these are outnumbered by the positive and neutral signals. Institutional inflow news and Powell's remarks add to the positive sentiment, and the technical setup on multiple timeframes supports a continued rally. The aggregate sentiment is buy, with high conviction for a continued move upwards.",
