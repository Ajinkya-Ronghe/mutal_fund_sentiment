    "explanation": "Across the live opinions, sentiment for BTC is mixed but with a bullish tilt: many discuss holding or buying, several mention significant support and psychological levels (107000, 108000, 115000), and multiple comments describe recent profitable long trades and holding strategies. There are some short calls and concerns about volatility, but the prevailing tone is that BTC remains dominant, with upward momentum likely if support holds. Leverage discussions suggest experienced traders are comfortable with high leverage, and many look for entries on dips. Some warnings about volatility and the need for caution are present, but there is no overwhelming negative consensus.",
