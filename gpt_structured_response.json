There is mention of potential further falls and volatility, but several opinions recommend buying the dip or not missing BTC, with references to a bullish longer-term outlook and positive momentum. The candlestick signal is mixed due to opposing live calls, but the net sentiment leans toward buying for the next upward move.",
