    "explanation": "The majority of opinions are bullish or supportive of BTC's upside potential. Multiple users mention BTC pumping, breaking resistance, and having a 'leg up' to go. There are several calls for 'buy', 'long', and 'upside' entries, reinforced by both sentiment and specific levels (targets such as 108500, 109100, etc.). Users refer to positive macro events (e.g., 'Trump is bullish', 'we survived Powell'), technical bounces, and big rejection zones being absorbed. Notably, there's repeated advice to enter long, to 'add qty', and that 'no one can drop BTC now'. Some mention large asset managers (e.g., Fidelity) supporting BTC's evolution. Negative and neutral opinions are present but not dominant: a few warn of short opportunities at higher levels, and some mention stop-loss hits or temporary pullbacks, but the overwhelming tone remains bullish. The representative opinions highlight this mix, but the buy/long sentiment is clearly strongest.",
