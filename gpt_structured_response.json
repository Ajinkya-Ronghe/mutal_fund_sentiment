    "explanation": "The majority of public sentiment points to bearish movement for BTC in the immediate term. Multiple users like Multigang, Corey, and Target Hit mention short positions, targets below current price (tp 1 106200), and a desire for limit shorts to hit. Some mention low volume and bear divergence as reasons for weakness. However, a few users (MOON CAT, Kane, Thunder, Ruben van Eek) reference bullish potential or strong hands, but these are fewer and more speculative. Liquidity comments are mixed, but the short-side conviction is clearer in this time frame.",
