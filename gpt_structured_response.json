    "explanation": "Multiple participants anticipate a breakout and upward movement for BTC, especially if key levels hold (e.g., 108800). Repeated mentions of targeting all-time highs and bullish projections (up to 119-125k by end of June) increase confidence. Sentiment is further reinforced by positive remarks on miners/treasuries and technical targets (VWAP). Only a few cautious/neutral opinions are present, with almost no direct negative sentiment.",
