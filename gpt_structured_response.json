    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term sentiments (notably from intra-day traders mentioning shorts and SL hits), there is a strong bullish bias in the overall community with repeated calls for new all-time highs, expectations of upward movement after periods of liquidity grabs and short liquidations, and several users suggesting spot buying and holding. Comments about resilience in BTC's hash rate and bullish news (such as US gold sales for BTC) further support a positive outlook. The presence of fakeouts, stop-loss hunts, and volatility is acknowledged, but the prevailing opinion is a continuation towards the upside, especially on any retracements or dips.",
