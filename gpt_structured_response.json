    "explanation": "The majority of the live chat opinions suggest bullish sentiment for BTC, with several participants expecting further upward movement, new all-time highs, or specific higher targets (e.g., 108k, 112k). While there are calls for shorting and some profit-taking at current levels, the overall mood is optimistic, referencing explosive moves, price targets above 108k, supply shocks, and FOMO. Despite some warnings of dumps or fake pumps, the positive-to-negative opinion ratio is strongly in favor of continued upside. Technical factors such as bounces off important EMAs and mentions of supply zones drying up reinforce the bullish bias. There is also acknowledgement of large players and companies buying, adding to the confidence. Leverage should be kept moderate and isolated due to volatility.",
