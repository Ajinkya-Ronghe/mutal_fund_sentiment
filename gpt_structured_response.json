    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is currently mixed with a bearish leaning. Many comments mention downside, shorting, and expectations for further drops (references to falls to 100k, 104k, and a 'critical zone'). Some still see resiliency, bounces, or possible upside if major levels hold, but the majority of actionable opinions are focused on short setups, downtrends, and risk management. Positive momentum is discussed only if trendlines or supports hold. Immediate caution is warranted due to volatility, recent value drops, and a lack of unified bullish conviction.",
