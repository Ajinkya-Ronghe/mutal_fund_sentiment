Several participants warn about possible traps for long positions, mention recent rejections at critical resistance levels (trendline, double top on 1h), and suggest the need for a retracement before considering long entries. While some mention potential for upside, the consensus for immediate action is to avoid longing and possibly consider a short, especially on lower timeframes.",
