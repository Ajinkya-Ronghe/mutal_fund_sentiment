    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat leans bullish for BTC, with repeated mentions of strong support at the current levels, expectations of a breakout towards new all-time highs (ATH), and a consensus that macro conditions (such as dropping bond yields, increasing liquidity, and decreasing DXY) are supportive of further price appreciation. Several experienced traders mention holding their long positions, targeting levels above 109kâ112k, and viewing dips as opportunities to go long. There is active discussion of spoofing orders attracting price upward, and very few express conviction in sustained shorts, with most shorts being seen as counter-trend or temporary. The dominance of BTC in the crypto market is noted, and some warn against fighting the bullish trend. While there are minor short-term doubts and some liquidations, the representative opinions and the count of positive vs. negative remarks strongly support a high-confidence long/Buy signal with up to 20x leverage for isolated/perpetual futures.",
