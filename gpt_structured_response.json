    "explanation": "Across the live chat, the sentiment for BTC is predominantly bullish with repeated calls for new entries, confirmations of ongoing buys, and many participants discussing holding or re-entering long positions. Several users report booking profits on BTC, and there are direct questions about the next long entry, targets, and holding strategy. There is also discussion about key levels (e.g., 107455, 108500, 109000), with calls to buy on dips and expectations of upward movement. While a few users mention possible short-term pullbacks or stop-loss hits, the consensus and active trade direction remains on the long/buy side. The mention of 'fat chuka hai' (BTC has pumped) is met with further encouragement to participate in the upside, and users are actively seeking buy signals and holding advice from stream leaders. Leverage discussions suggest moderate to high risk appetite among participants.",
