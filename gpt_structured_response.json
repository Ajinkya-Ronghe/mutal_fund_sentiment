    "explanation": "Multiple participants highlighted bullish signals for BTC, including dominance retracements (0.618 fib), strong buy triggers, and expectations of moves to 108,500 and higher. There is notable sentiment that retail capitulation has already occurred, a bullish reversal is anticipated, and several participants have open long trades and are booking profits. While some expressed caution or short-term pullbacks, the majority of actionable opinions indicate a strong, renewed upside bias for BTC. Technical analysis references (trendline breaks, retests, and breakout levels) further support long entries. The mood is also reinforced by broader macro narratives about BTC's future value versus fiat. Leverage discussions indicated up to 20x is considered 'safe' by some traders in the current market environment.",
