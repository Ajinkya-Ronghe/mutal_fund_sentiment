    "explanation": "Multiple participants mention BTC's recent strong moves, with some noting 'BTC dom so strong', 'BTC long order set', and 'BTC buy on deep chal rha hai'. Others report successful long positions and mention key resistance levels being broken (e.g., 'Broke $106500 nice! Itâs BTC time.', 'BTC 108500 tak jaega'). Despite short-term liquidation clusters and some warnings of possible retracement or liquidity sweeps, the dominant sentiment is bullish, especially for intraday or short-term trading. Several are either in profit on long trades or seeking new long entries, and there's little panic among holders. The few negative or cautionary opinions (warnings of rejection or liquidity sweeps) are far outweighed by those expressing confidence in continued upward momentum and strong bullish structure.",
