    "explanation": "The majority of active traders in the chat are cautious or expecting a retracement after recent gains. Multiple references to failed retests on the 1-minute and 15-minute timeframes, warnings about potential bull traps, and suggestions to wait for a retracement before entering new longs indicate short-term bearish sentiment. However, some are still optimistic about higher long-term targets, so confidence is not high.",
