    "explanation": "There is a strong bullish consensus in the live chat for BTC, with multiple mentions of 'go bulls', 'bought btc now', and users expressing confidence for a move to higher levels (targets of 109k, 600k, 300k for 2028, etc.). Several users specifically mention entering long positions, holding BTC, or buying dips. Technical comments reference bullish patterns like cup and handle, breakouts, and trendline breaks. Some experienced traders note that shorting BTC here is dangerous and that it's time to fly. While there are a few bearish or short-term bearish takes (such as shorts near 108k and some references to stops being hit), the overall majority of opinions are optimistic on a buy or long signal, especially for short-term moves. Additionally, Marticlues AI signals confirm multiple WBTC/USDT long calls, further strengthening confidence.",
