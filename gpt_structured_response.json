There are frequent mentions of new all-time highs (ATH), short squeezes, and positive news expected for BTC. Many traders discuss holding long positions or waiting for further upside, and multiple users report active long trades or expectation of a price rally toward 108,000-110,000 or even 225,000. Some short-term corrections and volatility are noted, but the majority expects higher price action, referencing historical patterns and optimism around bullish momentum. Even those expressing caution or short-term short trades often mention adding to longs or waiting for another long opportunity, indicating a dominant buy-side outlook.",
