Notably: 'BTC geht bald in Keller, Bier holen.... Short >.<', 'chuamishael - Audio Library: but I already shorted both on 107k and 108k just in case.', 'Mix videos: bro sell le', 'FitZoneX: short it now', and multiple references to cautious or bearish setups. However, a few users still mention buying or possible recoveries, but the overall tone leans toward short-term selling pressure or further downside risk, suggesting a sell/short signal with medium confidence.",
