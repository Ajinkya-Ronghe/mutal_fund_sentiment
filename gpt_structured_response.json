    "explanation": "BTC sentiment remains bullish in the current session, with multiple users referencing upward price targets (107,700, 108,300, 114,000, 121,000). Technical analysis discussion points to strong uptrend signals from daily and 4h stochastics; several mention the break above $106,500 as a trigger for further upward movement. While some short-term scalping and local resistance notes (such as 108k-109k and POC at 104800) are present, the overall community consensus is for continuation to new highs barring any significant negative news. No significant negative catalysts were raised beyond normal volatility and local pullbacks, and there is a high count of requests for BTC trade signals and entries, showing strong interest and confidence in further upside.",
