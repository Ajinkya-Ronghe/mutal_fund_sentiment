    "explanation": "Multiple participants indicated strong bullish sentiment for BTC, referencing trendline support, accumulation of profits, and calls to long and hold positions. Some users reported significant point captures and successful long trades, while others discussed support holding, price fighting to get back up, and expectations of a move to 108,500 or higher. There is a general consensus that despite some volatility and stop-loss hits, BTC is in a bullish mode on larger timeframes and the trendline is holding well. The few negative or bearish comments were outweighed by positive sentiment and momentum references.",
