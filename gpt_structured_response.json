    "explanation": "Several users express bullishness on BTC with projected targets as high as $120k and $130k, and multiple calls to buy or go long. There are also short-term concerns about volatility and possible dumps, but the dominant sentiment in the recent comments is to buy or accumulate on dips. Some users mention resistance at 108k and shorting from 107700, but broader crowd signals and recent live chart references indicate more positive than negative sentiment, with ongoing interest in leveraging up, especially on isolated/perpetual futures. Risk remains due to macro/FED uncertainty, but the crowd is leaning bullish.",
