    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions and discussions indicate a persistent bullish sentiment for BTC, with many suggesting new long entries, holding current positions, and expecting moves toward 108,500â109,000 and even higher. Several users reported booking profits at higher levels and are looking to re-enter long trades. Discussion around support and resistance zones, as well as suggestions to buy on dips, reinforce the current buy trend. No significant negative sentiment is present, while some warn of volatility and the need for strict stop-loss management. The overall momentum, based on both technical and emotional crowd signals, remains upward.",
