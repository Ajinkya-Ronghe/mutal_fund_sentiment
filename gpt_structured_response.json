    "explanation": "Despite some concerns about hashrate drops and potential for volatility, the overall sentiment is bullish. Many participants expect BTC to reach new highs (targets from 108,500 up to 123,000 and even 120,000+ are mentioned), with sideways consolidation seen as an opportunity for a breakout. Some warn of short-term pullbacks and false breakouts, but the prevailing expectation is for further upside after consolidation or a healthy pullback. Several users explicitly ask about long entries, and others note that shorts are being 'eaten alive.' Support remains strong above key levels and even those cautious about short-term corrections still anticipate a bullish continuation. No strong negative consensus, and the majority of representative opinions are positive or neutral-to-positive.",
