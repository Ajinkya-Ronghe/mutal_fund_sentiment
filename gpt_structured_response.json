    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term opinions (with both short and long calls), overall sentiment in the live chat and signals leans bullish for BTC. Multiple traders and bots provided active long signals with defined entry and targets (e.g., Marticlues AI: Long BTC/USDT:ENTRY=107035.38,TP1=107249.45...), and several participants highlighted bullish setups, breakout levels, and potential for higher moves. Notably, some warned about high volatility and the importance of stop loss management, but the recurring recommendation is to buy or hold, especially above key levels like 106,500. Market momentum and buy signals are noted even as short-term corrections are discussed, with the consensus expecting higher BTC prices in the near term.",
