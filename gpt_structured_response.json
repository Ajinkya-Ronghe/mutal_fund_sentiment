    "explanation": "The majority of recent live opinions and trade alerts indicate bullish sentiment for BTC. There are multiple mentions of BTC breaking significant resistance levels (including 108k and 106.5k), potential for all-time-highs, and strong upward momentum observed in candlestick patterns (multiple green candles, breakout confirmations). Many users reported profit-taking on longs and calls for holding or buying. Algorithmic trading signals, such as the Marticlues AI, issued a BTC/USDT long signal with clear take-profit levels above current price action. Although some short or bearish warnings exist, the positive momentum and FOMO (fear of missing out) are strongly echoed by retail traders. Multiple users confirm buying, holding, or booking profit on BTC, and there is general agreement that leverage up to 20x is considered safe by some community members. The overall risk appetite and momentum favor a long position.",
