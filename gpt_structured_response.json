    "explanation": "Multiple participants referenced strong liquidity zones near 105k-108k, with some expecting reversals or support holding, and several discussing consolidation and potential for upward moves. There is mention of sellers starting to enter, but the prevailing sentiment includes references to demand zones, green candles incoming, and a possible V-shape recovery. Positive opinions about BTC making new highs if no negative news occurs, and many requests for BTC trade entry and overview, indicate strong real-time interest and anticipation for a bullish move. Short-term bearishness exists but is often countered by expectations of support holding or a bounce. The overall bias in the live opinions is for an imminent or ongoing upward move, making a long signal with high confidence appropriate. Leverage recommendations from the chat suggest high risk-tolerance, but a safe leverage is set at 20x for risk management.",
