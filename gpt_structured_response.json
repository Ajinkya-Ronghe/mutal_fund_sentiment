    "explanation": "BTC is experiencing high volatility and uncertainty. Several participants anticipate a drop toward the 104k-105k support range, referencing sell volume at resistance and potential exhaustion of the recent uptrend. There are also warnings about potential big dumps due to macroeconomic news (e.g. Fed rate decisions). However, some express long-term accumulation strategies and brief bullishness on dips. The dominant short-term sentiment leans bearish due to resistance, failed breakouts, and an expected liquidity sweep.",
