    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat skews bullish for BTC, with many participants discussing buy setups, holding long, and expecting upward price action (targets like 107,500, 108,500, 110,000 mentioned). There is acknowledgment of volatility and some mixed short-term opinions, but the consensus leans toward further upside or bounces rather than sustained selling. Multiple users mention entering or holding long, asking for buy entries, and others suggest adding on dips. Sell calls are present but are fewer and often met with counterarguments for recovery or buying support. Chart-based and liquidity comments also highlight support levels holding, with institutions and retail both being trapped but no clear confirmation for a short. The repeated reference to marking previous highs and lows, and the lack of conviction among shorts, further supports a long bias. High leverage is being discussed, but caution is noted regarding extreme leverage (50x, 75x, 100x), so a safer but still aggressive 20x isolated perpetual is recommended.",
