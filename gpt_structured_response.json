    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest bearish sentiment or skepticism about immediate upside for BTC. Comments like 'bull trap', 'down she goes', 'waterfall next', and 'bears are in control' indicate expectations of a downward move. While some bullish opinions exist (e.g., 'BUY BUY BUY', 'BTC to 1 million soon if dollar crashes'), they are fewer and often conditional on extreme events. No clear consensus supports a strong Buy signal at this moment, and short-term signals lean bearish or cautious.",
