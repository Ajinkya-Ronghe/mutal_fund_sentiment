    "explanation": "Despite some mixed short-term opinions, the overall sentiment for BTC is bullish. There is strong mention of BTC overperforming other assets in the last 24 hours, ETF inflows hitting record highs, and price retaking major psychological levels. Several participants discuss holding or buying more, expecting further upside, and technical analysis references support the potential for new highs. A few caution about resistance and overbought signals, but the consensus remains to buy or hold. The safe leverage for an isolated perpetual future is set at 20x, with higher leverages being viewed as excessive and risky by most. The majority of opinions are positive or neutral, with very few negative signals. The most representative comments reflect both the optimism for breakout and some technical caution, but the buy case is dominant.",
