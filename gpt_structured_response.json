    "explanation": "Across the live chat, multiple users expressed optimism about BTC's price movement, with calls for long entries, mentions of uptrend continuation, and support at key levels (e.g., 106600, 107200, 108500). Several commented on BTC being at or approaching all-time highs, and there is a notable bullish sentiment regarding retest entries and the next major move. Although a few users discussed short-term pullbacks or holding stops, the majority of actionable opinions, especially those referencing 1-minute and higher timeframes, favor long/buy setups. Representative opinions include explicit calls to 'long now', 'BTC LONG ENTRY NOW', and expectations of higher targets (e.g., 108500, 109k, 115k). Support for leverage trading and safe leverage practices was also mentioned. Overall, the positive sentiment and technical focus on breakouts, retests, and uptrends outweigh the few negative or neutral comments.",
