    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed but with increasing bullish signals and strong support at higher levels. Multiple users mention targets above 108k (e.g., 108500), with calls for long positions both at 107100 and general encouragement to hold or buy. Some bearish and short opinions exist, but they are outnumbered by positive or neutral-to-positive positions. Frequent references to strong technical analysis, live calls for buying, and confidence in BTC's upward move (many referencing 'bulls', 'long', or 'buy' signals). No significant negative news or panic in the opinions. Leverage up to 20x is reasonable for experienced traders given the volatility and trend, as discussed. Representative opinions below.",
