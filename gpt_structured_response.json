    "explanation": "A majority of opinions show traders recommending booking profits but also considering re-entries on dips or after trendline breaks, with several expecting higher targets (107200, 109k, even 111900/122k). There is strong discussion of bullish structures (bull flag, new ATH, BTC dominance), and multiple mentions of buying support or after retracements. However, there are also warnings of manipulation, possible pullbacks, and some bearish commentary (liquidations above 108.7k, manipulation, 'down' sentiments). The overall consensus leans toward buying on dips, with a moderately bullish outlook, but not without caution and short-term volatility.",
