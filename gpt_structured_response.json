    "explanation": "Opinions on BTC are mixed but lean positive. Some comments indicate bullishness due to support retests and recent price action (e.g. retesting support, 'BTC just re-tested 99k and now it's 107k', 'we pumping', 'bull flag'), while a few users express hesitation or mention potential for a short-term dip. Several participants reference technical patterns and rate cut anticipation as bullish catalysts. There are no clear consensus signals for an aggressive move, but the majority of actionable sentiment is constructive, with risk management and technical levels emphasized.",
