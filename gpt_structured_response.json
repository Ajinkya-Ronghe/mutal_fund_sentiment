    "explanation": "Despite some bearish short-term sentiment and volatility, the overall consensus from recent live opinions suggests strong bullish momentum ahead for BTC. Multiple participants discuss trendline support on short timeframes, signals to wait for a long entry, and expectations for significant upside targets (e.g., 70k, 103k, 120k, 240k). Several traders mention buying at current levels, holding through dips, or waiting for confirmation of reversal to re-enter long. Notably, large fluctuations are expected in the next weeks, but the majority are seeking buy setups and expressing positive sentiment for BTC's next move. Candlestick and trendline analysis on 1m, 15m, and 1h timeframes are referenced as supporting bullish entries.",
