    "explanation": "Multiple participants mentioned breaking key resistance levels (106600, 107200, 108000), and anticipation of a potential new all-time high. There is visible optimism due to positive pre-market tech stock performance, bullish stochastic indicators, and bullish sentiment in the chat. Some are holding or entering longs, and several expect further upside with minor dips. Although a few mention the possibility of a short-term dip or bull trap, the collective sentiment, momentum, and technical signals favor a long/buy with high confidence. Leverage up to 20x is considered safely justified due to the strong trend and market activity.",
