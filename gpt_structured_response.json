    "explanation": "Despite some short-term bearish sentiment and ongoing volatility, the live chat shows significant support and interest around critical support levels (106,500-108,000), with many traders holding or planning new long entries. There is strong acknowledgment of bullish structure on higher timeframes, and the breakout above 106,500 is seen as a key bullish signal. While some participants are short or cautious due to tricky market conditions and rapid swings, the overall sentiment leans towards an expectation of upward movement after consolidation, with substantial liquidity targets above and consistent interest in long setups. Representative opinions also include concerns about bear cycles and large stop losses, but these are counterbalanced by active long trades and calls to 'buy BTC and hold.'",
