    "explanation": "Despite a mix of bearish and bullish short-term opinions, the overall sentiment leans bullish with multiple mentions of high targets (70k, 103k, 105k, 108k, 120k), active buying, and calls to hold or enter long. Several users report profits, discuss trendline support, and reference bullish candlestick patterns. Some uncertainty and volatility is noted, but more comments urge patience or buying than selling. Even with discussions of dumps or corrections, the dominant actionable advice is to buy, especially on dip entries, and to avoid panic selling.",
