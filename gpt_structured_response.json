    "explanation": "A significant number of participants in the live chat expressed bullish sentiment towards BTC, expecting price increases and referencing technical and fundamental factors. Key comments included expectations of breaking above resistance at 107,200â108,000, bullish confirmation from tech stocks and stochastic indicators, and several users sharing that they have switched from short to long positions or are buying dips. There was also discussion of positive news, such as the Federal Reserve chair's supportive statement on crypto activities, and anticipation of new all-time highs. While a few users mentioned possible short-term corrections or bull traps, the majority leaned towards upward momentum, especially for scalping and swing trades.",
