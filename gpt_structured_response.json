    "explanation": "Despite a significant split in sentiment with many retail traders shorting or calling for a dump, the presence of strong institutional interest, repeated local lows getting absorbed, and recurring mentions of FOMO, breakouts above resistance, and large players accumulating point to underlying bullish momentum. The price has shown resilience at key support levels, with several opinions noting 'grinding higher' and 'always long.' The overall market structure suggests a trap for shorts and potential for a quick move higher as shorts get squeezed. High volatility and frequent false moves are noted, but the consensus risk-reward for a long scalp is strong. Safe leverage is set to 20x to manage volatility and avoid liquidation risk in this highly liquid market phase.",
