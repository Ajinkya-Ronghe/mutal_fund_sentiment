    "explanation": "BTC is experiencing a strong bullish momentum, breaking through major resistance levels around 108k and showing resilience against typical pullbacks. Multiple participants report successful long trades, profit booking at higher targets, and expectations of continued upside with minimal retracement. Despite some warnings about overbought conditions and possible short-term pullbacks, the dominant sentiment is bullish, with traders targeting higher levels (109k, 111k, and even 112k+). Short liquidations and strong buying pressure are evident, and several users are asking about safe leverage, with 20x commonly cited. While a few mention caution at resistance and potential for a reversal, the bullish signals and successful long entries far outweigh negative or neutral voices.",
