    "explanation": "Despite significant short-term bearish sentiment and calls for a pullback, there is strong evidence of bullish momentum for BTC, including mentions of recent breakouts over key levels ($106,500), ETF inflows, FOMO, accumulation phases, and calls for higher targets (e.g., $108,500, $108,900, $109,000, $110,000). Large inflows and institutional interest (ETF, 'billions want a piece of BTC'), as well as positive candlestick and breakout signals, support a high-confidence long entry. The candlestick signal is supported by multiple traders noting breakouts, retests, and bullish supply/demand imbalances. Negative sentiment is present but frequently countered by bullish momentum and dip-buying recommendations. Pullbacks are seen as buying opportunities, not trend reversals.",
