    "explanation": "Majority of the live opinions express bullish sentiment for BTC, referencing imminent new highs, strong demand exceeding supply, and positive macro events like anticipated rate cuts. Several key resistance levels (108k, 109k, 111-113k) are discussed as near-term targets. Even as some mention shorting at local tops or expecting retracements, the overwhelming commentary is about BTC's strength, rocket-like movement, and ongoing FOMO. Technical setups (break of descending channel, liquidity zones, trendline breakout) support upward momentum. Traders are seeking long entries and discussing how to hold or add to positions. No major negative fundamental or sentiment shift is observed.",
