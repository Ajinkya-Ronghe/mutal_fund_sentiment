    "explanation": "The majority of comments referencing BTC are bullish, mentioning pumps, breakouts, new all-time highs, and strong buyer control. Many users are discussing long positions, future upside targets (e.g., 120k, 122k), and the potential for a breakout. A few voices caution about corrections or channel resistance, but these are outnumbered by the bullish sentiment and recent price action excitement. Short-term momentum is clearly upward per crowd consensus.",
