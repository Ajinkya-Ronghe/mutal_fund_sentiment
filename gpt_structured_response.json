    "explanation": "The majority of relevant BTC comments indicate expectations of upside or bullishness, referencing trend respect on the 15min, support above the 50 MA, and anticipation of a move up to higher price zones (e.g., 108500, 110k). There are also calls for entries and some buy confirmations, but there is notable mention of sideways and choppy markets, as well as warnings about volatility and the need for caution. Therefore, confidence is not high, but the overall sentiment leans long.",
