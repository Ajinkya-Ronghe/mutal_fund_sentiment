    "explanation": "Opinions show BTC is in a slow movement but holding a bullish channel with breakout attempts, double bottom patterns, and uptrend signals on higher timeframes (4hr, 15min). Some traders are accumulating or planning to buy, and there is conviction from participants who have moved capital into BTC. However, there is notable hesitation and mentions of resistance at 107700, potential for sharp drops if support breaks, and mixed opinions regarding consolidation and sideways action, which tempers high confidence.",
