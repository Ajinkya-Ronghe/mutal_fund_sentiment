    "explanation": "BTC is showing strong resilience above key support levels with multiple users noting significant upside momentum, large profit-taking by longs, and expectations of further gains if Powell hints at rate cuts. There is continued bullish sentiment despite some shorting activity, with several users capturing large profits on recent long trades and expecting 109k+ targets soon. The presence of cup and handle patterns and positive correlation with gold's rise further supports a bullish bias. Short-term corrections are mentioned, but overall sentiment and technicals favor a buy on dips approach.",
