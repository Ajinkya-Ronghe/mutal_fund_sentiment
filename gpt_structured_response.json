    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions reflect bearish sentiment for BTC. Several participants cite weakness at key levels (107k-109k), mention exhaustion among bulls, and anticipate further downside, including large drops and rejection from current resistance. A few are considering long positions if support holds, but the dominant view is a short-term pullback. A 1-minute candlestick strategy would favor shorting with a tight stop loss due to high volatility and mixed but mostly negative sentiment.",
