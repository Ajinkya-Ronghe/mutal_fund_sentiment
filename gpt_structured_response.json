SHORT it and forget.'), suggestions to 'dump' BTC, and concerns about price getting rejected at technical indicators (e.g., VWAP, Ichimoku Cloud). A few are holding or buying dips, but the short-term view is cautious to bearish. There is no strong bullish conviction for immediate buying, and several traders express doubt about an imminent rally.",
