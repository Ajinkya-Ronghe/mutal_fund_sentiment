    "explanation": "Despite short-term volatility and mixed views, overall sentiment for BTC remains bullish. There are multiple mentions of ETF inflows reaching new highs (billions in recent weeks), institutional FOMO, anticipation of price climbing toward or above $108,000, and strong community engagement on dip buying. While some expect corrections or pullbacks, the consensus is that demand and fresh inflows will support price appreciation. Technical signals (breakouts, retests, supply/demand zones) and trading community sentiment (many looking for new entries or holding positions) further support an upside bias. Some volatility is expected, but the medium-term fund flow and broader market context remain highly favorable. Leverage should be capped at 20x for risk management due to recent volatility.",
