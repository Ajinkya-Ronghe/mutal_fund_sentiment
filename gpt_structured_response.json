    "explanation": "Discussion participants expressed caution on longing BTC, noting a double top on the 1h chart, recent rejections, and a need for a retracement after a significant run-up. Some are waiting for more price action and see potential traps for longs. There are mixed views with some long positions mentioned, but the prevailing sentiment is to wait or consider a short bias until a meaningful pullback. No direct 1-minute strong long signals were observed in the chat.",
