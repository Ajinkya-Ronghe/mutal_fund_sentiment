    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate bullish momentum for BTC, with references to breakouts on higher timeframes (4h, weekly), bullflags, and the possibility of a new all-time high. However, there is also notable bearish sentiment regarding possible resistance at 108k-109k, some shorting activity, and recent volatility and liquidations. The 1-minute candlestick sentiment is slightly bullish due to frequent mentions of scalping, trend continuation above key levels, and positive momentum, but with caution due to resistance zones and mixed short-term speculation.",
