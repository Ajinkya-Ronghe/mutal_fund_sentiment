    "explanation": "Despite a significant number of short calls and profit-taking, there is strong bullish sentiment for BTC in both the short and medium term. Many traders mention missed opportunities on the upside, discuss targets above 108,000, and reference upcoming news and supply shocks fueling further upside. Voices calling for a new all-time high, positive FOMO, and several users reporting substantial profits or anticipation of further gains indicate the market is leaning bullish. The presence of shorts and hedge talk is noted, but overall, the upward narrative is more influential, and recent price action has confirmed higher levels are being tested. The market is volatile, but disciplined buying and holding are being rewarded.",
