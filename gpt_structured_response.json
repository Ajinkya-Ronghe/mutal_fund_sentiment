    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest current bullish momentum for BTC, with several users reporting active long trades, successful long entries, and expectations of further upward movement. Some users mentioned earlier resistance at 108k-109k and profit-taking, but the sentiment has shifted to 'buy' or 'go long' after minor corrections and retests. Multiple comments highlight BTC outperforming alts, positive institutional perspectives (e.g., Fidelity), and user interest in holding or entering new long positions. A few users note caution around resistance or recommend securing profits, but negative sentiment is minimal and outweighed by bullish momentum and community participation.",
