    "explanation": "There is a mixture of short and long opinions, but several comments highlight bullish technical signals: references to a potential bounce at 107,750, targets as high as 111,400-114,000, and a breakout after a 1min retest. Some warn of traps or sideways movement, but the consensus leans toward upside potential after sweeping liquidity. Recent breakouts above key levels (e.g., 101,600) are also seen as bullish confirmations. However, the presence of shorting sentiment and calls for caution reduce the confidence level.",
