    "explanation": "Despite some calls for shorting and market volatility due to global events, the majority of sentiment on BTC remains bullish. Many users emphasize BTC's dominance, scarcity, and its tendency to recover after dips. Several community members note that BTC's dominance is still strong, and as long as this persists, the main flow remains into BTC over alts. Technical comments reference bullish patterns, support at key levels (107k), and strong uptrends on candlestick charts. Representative opinions include optimism for higher price targets, a belief in BTC's long-term uptrend, and calls to buy or hold even amid short-term corrections. Short calls exist but are outnumbered by positive or neutral-to-positive views.",
