    "explanation": "The majority of opinions are extremely bullish on BTC, with several participants predicting significant long-term upside (1 million USD in 5 years, 22 million in 20 years), repeated encouragement to buy and never sell, and positive sentiment regarding BTC's resilience and bullish momentum. Only a few negative or short-term bearish comments appear, but they are outweighed by the strong, confident long calls and community optimism. There is no strong technical disagreement, and the overall mood is very positive.",
