    "explanation": "A significant majority of current live opinions reference bullish sentiment, active long trades, and institutional support for BTC. Many discuss recent trendline support, resistance flips, and expectations of further upward moves, with specific price targets above current levels (107k, 108.5k, 109k). Major asset managers (Fidelity) continue to endorse BTC and crypto as evolving. Traders refer to successful recovery after Powell's speech, with some noting 'trap the bears' and only BTC reacting positively in sideways markets. Numerous comments confirm live long entries, profit-taking on longs, and continuing to buy dips. Representative negative or neutral comments mostly concern short-term pullbacks or longing at lower levels. Overall, the momentum and institutional narratives are overwhelmingly positive.",
