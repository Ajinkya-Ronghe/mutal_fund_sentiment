    "explanation": "Most live comments reflect negative sentiment around BTC's recent price movements, including talk of 'dumping,' 'big dumps,' and references to support lines being tested, along with mentions of DXY (dollar index) pumping, which often correlates with BTC dropping. Some hope for a bounce exists but it is not dominant. Candlestick momentum appears downward in the short term, but there is no strong panic or capitulation, leading to a medium confidence short signal.",
