    "explanation": "Despite some bearish calls and short-term volatility, the overall sentiment in the live chat is bullish for BTC. Multiple users mention going long or holding long positions, expecting higher targets, and expressing confidence in further upside. There is also mention of strong buying interest around support zones, bullish divergence discussions, and FOMO among traders. While some users mention booking partial profits or setting stop-losses at cost, the majority opinion leans towards buying or holding BTC. Additionally, users are actively seeking re-entry points, discussing leveraged trades, and showing high engagement and excitement about potential upward moves. Negative opinions (shorts, doubts) are present but outnumbered by positive/bullish commentary.",
