    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bearish in the short term. Many users discuss shorting at current levels (107-108k), expecting further downside or relief drops. There is mention of exhaustion after a strong up-move and concerns about liquidity grabs and stop hunts. However, there are some bullish voices expecting another push higher or longer-term upside. The positive and negative opinion counts are close, indicating indecision, but the immediate crowd focus is on short-term correction and volatility.",
