    "explanation": "Multiple users are discussing active trading zones, with levels around 107k-108k as key supports and resistance. Several opinions point to liquidity sweeps, potential for a further pump, and profit-taking at higher levels, indicating strong participation and upside momentum. Comments include expectations of a push higher before a dump, and that BTC will not see these low prices again after this cycle. Short-term volatility is acknowledged, but the dominant sentiment is for continued bullish momentum with institutional interest and market structure supporting higher prices. There are neutral and negative takes about possible retracements, but the positive momentum and institutional narratives are stronger. A safe leverage of up to 20x is suggested given the volatility and rapid movement.",
