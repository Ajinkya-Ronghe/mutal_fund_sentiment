    "explanation": "Multiple participants express bullish sentiment and expectations for BTC to reach or exceed new all-time highs (ATH) if key levels hold. Talk of short-term support at 108,000 and anticipation of moves to the 110,550-111,983 range, with some even projecting 119-125k by end of June, indicates strong confidence in upward momentum. The mood is predominantly optimistic, with only minor caution about swings and leverage risk.",
