Multiple participants mention key support levels (107200, 107k, 106900) and the risk of a sharp drop if these are breached. There is mention of heavy sell orders, market manipulation, and expectations of a 'mega dump.' Some users see potential for a small pump, but sentiment overall leans negative or cautious, with warnings about liquidations and manipulation.",
