    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions indicate bullish sentiment for BTC, with repeated references to long positions, targets above current prices (e.g., 108k-110k, 225k), and calls to 'buy' or 'go long.' Traders highlight retail shorting being squeezed, positive news expectations, and technical signals (RSI, pivot/R2, Donchian channel bounce) supporting further upside. Some users mention trailing stop-losses on long positions, and several ask directly if now is a good entry for BTC long. Negative or neutral comments exist but are outnumbered by positive/bullish ones.",
