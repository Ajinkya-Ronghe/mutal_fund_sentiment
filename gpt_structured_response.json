    "explanation": "The overall sentiment is mixed with some bullish calls for very high targets (e.g., 280K), short-term bullishness (e.g., 'abhi upar hi rahega', 'breaking uptrend pressure rn'), and references to price discovery. There is also skepticism and short/neutral opinions, but the balance of opinions leans slightly bullish with several participants suggesting trendline support and potential upward moves. However, some caution due to bearish voices and volatility, so confidence is only medium.",
