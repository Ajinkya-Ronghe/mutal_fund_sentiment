    "explanation": "The majority of direct BTC-related opinions are bearish or expect short-term downward moves, citing lack of volume, bear indicators, negative funding, and expectations of liquidity sweeps to the downside. Some see potential for a bounce, but the consensus leans toward further downside or at best, choppy/neutral behavior with a bearish bias. There are scattered bullish or neutral voices, but they are fewer, less confident, or focus on longer timeframes.",
