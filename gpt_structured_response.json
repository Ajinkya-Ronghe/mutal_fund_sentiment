    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest bullish momentum for BTC, with many calling for higher price targets (multiple calls for 108k, 109k, and even 119k). There are frequent mentions of holding through pullbacks, successful long trades, and positive profit-taking at higher levels. Comments highlight strong buying support, bullish price action (e.g., 'super bullish', 'hold all buyers', 'all time high'), and robust trading activity. Despite isolated mentions of pullbacks, short-term dips, and some traders taking profit or shorting at specific resistances, the prevailing sentiment is upward, especially on 1-minute and short timeframes. Representative opinions point to confidence in further upward movement and resilience after minor corrections.",
