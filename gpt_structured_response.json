    "explanation": "Despite significant debate and intraday volatility, the prevailing sentiment favors a long (buy) position on BTC. Multiple participants observed that after any dips to the 104kâ106k range, BTC historically rebounds to all-time highs. There are numerous calls for buying at current or slightly lower levels, with traders noting supply zones, bullish engulfing patterns, and algorithmic buy signals. Some short-term bearishness is present due to recent dumps and bearish engulfing candles, but bulls are repeatedly referenced as returning, and there is consensus on strong support near 107k. The risk of sudden news-driven volatility is acknowledged, but the majority of active traders are looking for upward moves, trailing stop losses, or holding for higher targets (108.5kâ110k and beyond). Leverage should be managed carefully, with isolated 20x recommended for experienced users.",
