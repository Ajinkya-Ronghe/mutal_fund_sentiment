    "explanation": "The majority of opinions expressed caution or bearishness on BTC in the short term. Multiple participants discussed the risk of a further drop, potential retracement, and a lack of buy signals. Opinions like 'wait for short', 'would not long until we get a decent retracement', 'looks like a trap', and 'double top and rejected at high average weekly range' support a cautious or bearish view. There are a few bullish voices, but the consensus leans toward waiting for a better entry or expecting downside.",
