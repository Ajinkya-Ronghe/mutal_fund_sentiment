    "explanation": "Several opinions indicate ongoing interest in holding or entering BTC trades, with specific mention of 1-minute chart activity. Some participants refer to targets above 108k or 109k, and there are positive references to trading BTC live. However, the market sentiment appears mixed, with a few concerns about potential dumps and confusion around short-term direction. The discussion around RSI and market indicators shows that the current environment is not strongly trending, but more traders are inclined to hold or take new long positions on BTC, especially on lower timeframes.",
