    "explanation": "The majority of live opinions highlight bullish momentum, key levels being broken to the upside, and expectations of higher price targets (e.g., 108,500, 110,000, 114,000, 120,000, and even 150,000). Several participants mention strong technical factors such as money flow crossing green, 4h/daily stochastics turning bullish, and holding above important resistance. Despite some short-term traders debating pullbacks or local tops, the dominant sentiment is to buy, hold, or accumulate, especially with references to BTC being the main focus and outperforming other markets. There are multiple confirmations of critical level breaks and very little consensus for a bearish reversal. Occasional calls for profit-taking or shorting are outnumbered by bullish/holding opinions and expectations of a new all-time high.",
