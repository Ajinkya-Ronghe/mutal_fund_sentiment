    "explanation": "The majority of opinions anticipate a short-term decline for BTC, with multiple users referencing an imminent 'dump', 'short', and targets below current prices. Some users suggest prices could reach 109k or lower, and there is a general bearish sentiment regarding the immediate trend, though a few bullish voices exist. The candlestick signal is set to 'short' due to the predominance of short and sell suggestions in the 1-minute live sentiment.",
