Islandsteve repeatedly states he's been in a successful long all day, and Marticlues AI issues a long signal for WBTC/USDT with clear entries and take-profits. While there are isolated negative and neutral remarks, the majority are positive or supportive of upward momentum, with targets cited above current price. Some comments reference strong historical performance and technical patterns (triangle breakout), adding to the confidence.",
