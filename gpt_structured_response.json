    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is predominantly bullish for BTC. Multiple users are referencing major price targets like 107k, 108k, 109k, and even 120k, with mentions of 'rocket', 'moon', 'big pump coming', and 'bull flag daily'. Some users mention liquidity below 100k and expect volatility, but the prevailing feeling is that BTC is in an uptrend and could continue higher. There are sporadic mentions of 'short' or possible pullbacks, but these are outweighed by the positive and FOMO-driven commentary. The crowd expects new highs soon, and mentions of stop-hunting and support holding add to the conviction for an upside move.",
