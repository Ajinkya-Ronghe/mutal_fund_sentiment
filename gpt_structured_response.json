    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "BTC shows strong bullish sentiment based on high ETF inflows, recovery after geopolitical uncertainty, overperformance versus other assets, repeated calls for long entries above key resistance levels, and a consensus that dips are being bought. Several participants discuss technical triggers (e.g., value area highs, RSI levels, bullish weekly candle closes, Donchian channel bounces), with most viewing any retracement as a buying opportunity, and a few warning about high leverage risks. Current market context favors upside, with institutional flows, macro news, and price action aligning for potential continuation toward new all-time highs.",
