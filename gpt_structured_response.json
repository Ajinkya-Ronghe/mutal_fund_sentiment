    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is overall bullish, with many participants discussing active long trades, successful past entries, and expectations of further upside. Several users reference large institutional support (e.g., ETF flows, Fidelity positive statements), market resilience after Fed events, and technical indicators suggesting a pump or bounce. While some mention shorting at higher resistance levels, the dominant view is that BTC continues to attract large capital and will see further upward movement. Leverage should be managed carefully, but high confidence for long entries is reflected in the live chat.",
