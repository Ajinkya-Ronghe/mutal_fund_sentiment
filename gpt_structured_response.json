    "explanation": "A substantial number of participants are bullish on BTC, referencing price targets above 108,000 and 109,000, all-time high discussions, and positive sentiment around recent price action. Many users discuss holding, buying, or missing long trades, with a minority mentioning possible short-term pullbacks. The majority of opinions suggest strong upward momentum and continued FOMO, with several asking for optimal leverage (commonly 20x or above) and expressing regret for not entering long positions. Some technical references include breakout, flying, strong candles, and pole flag patterns, all indicating bullish bias.",
