    "explanation": "The majority of recent comments discuss bearish momentum, confirmations of short signals, warnings about a possible dump, and profit-taking behavior. While there are some positive remarks about long-term potential and bullish news (e.g., ETF inflows, regulatory acceptance for mortgages), short-term sentiment and technicals point toward downside risk. Some users mention key levels (e.g., $106,500) and hesitancy to long, and several warn that the market is over-hyped or inflated, suggesting caution or even short positions in the immediate term.",
