    "explanation": "The majority of the opinions indicate a bearish outlook for BTC in the very short term, with multiple users calling for lower prices and short positions. References to specific downside targets (e.g., 104K, 97K) and several mentions of 'short' or 'sell' outweigh the few bullish or neutral remarks. There is, however, some disagreement (e.g., 'DONT SHORT LOL'), making the consensus medium rather than high. No strong technical analysis is provided, but sentiment is clearly tilted bearish.",
