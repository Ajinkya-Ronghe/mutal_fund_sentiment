    "explanation": "Despite a mix of short-term bearish calls and warnings of 'traps' or potential pullbacks, the majority of sustained commentary and sentiment points to continued bullishness for BTC. Multiple users referenced new highs, strong support at higher levels, and significant buy-side interest around $108,000â$112,000. Even bearish participants mentioned waiting for higher prices before considering shorts, and scalpers repeatedly booked profits on upward moves. There is notable FOMO and a consensus expectation for the trend to remain up, especially given recent breakouts and discussions of major liquidity above current prices. The presence of strong positive momentum, large liquidity pools overhead, and traders recommending to 'buy dips' or maintain long bias, supports a high-confidence buy signal. Representative opinions include both direct calls to buy and positive reactions to price action, outweighing the negative and neutral sentiment.",
