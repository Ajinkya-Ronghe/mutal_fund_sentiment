    "explanation": "Across the live chat, BTC was discussed heavily with a mix of short-term volatility, but multiple users referenced bullish technical patterns (e.g., pole flag on 1h, bullish breakouts on 1hr, and upside liquidity grabs), with some awaiting new buy signals or asking for new BTC entry points. Some users referenced price targets above 108,000 and up to 109,000, and several comments reported profits from recent BTC buys. While there are mentions of both selling and buying, the majority of technical references and crowd sentiment lean toward a bullish move, especially on shorter timeframes. The presence of FOMO, references to 'cheap BTC', and repeated requests for entry signals reinforce a strong buy-side bias. Risk management is still advised due to volatility.",
