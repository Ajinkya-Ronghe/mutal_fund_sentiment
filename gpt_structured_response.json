    "explanation": "Despite some conflicting opinions and short-term volatility warnings, the majority of influential and active voices expect bullish movement in BTC, with targets ranging from 108,000 to 111,000 and even higher. Multiple users discussed bullish signals, positive price action, and potential for new highs. Several experienced traders recommended holding longs or adding to positions, and there are repeated calls for buying or holding BTC, especially on dips. The overall sentiment leans bullish, with many expecting a further rise after key resistance levels are broken. The presence of some bearish comments is typical for active markets but is outweighed by positive and neutral-to-bullish opinions, especially around liquidity grabs, swing trades, and 1-minute chart setups.",
