    "explanation": "Opinions are divided, but the majority recently signal caution or shorting BTC in the short-term. Several users reference expected further drops, downtrend initiation, and strong selling pressure near key levels (e.g., 106,500, 104,400). There is talk of manipulation, abrupt drops, and warnings to close longs. While a few mention possible bounces or recovery, the tone is largely bearish for now. Some positive swing long mentions exist, but the prevailing short-term sentiment is defensive.",
