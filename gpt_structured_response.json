    "explanation": "The sentiment from the live chat is mixed but slightly favors a short-term bearish view. Several users mention recent drops, downtrends, and expectations of further downside (e.g., 'Down....', 'fall will continue', 'down 10%', 'huge crash from 108k', 'short it', 'cup and handle pattern se BTC mein selling krke 700 point capture', 'entered a BTC short near this local top', 'that was the biggest value drop of the week', 'are you shorting right now'). Some users remain bullish or neutral, but the higher count of negative/downside signals combined with volatility and mentions of failed breakouts or consolidations support a cautious short bias on the 1-minute chart. However, the presence of some bullish and neutral comments (e.g., 'BTC upside ja sakta hai', 'abhi jb tk trend line ke upr hai tb tk to mere according upr ka hi plan rkhna chahie safe stop loss dekhkr', 'Btc C leg completed', 'Rockets incoming') moderates the confidence to medium.",
