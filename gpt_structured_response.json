    "explanation": "Despite significant volatility and a mix of short-term bearish sentiment, there are clear signals from algorithmic and experienced traders for imminent reversal and long setups. Several comments mention key support levels being defended, and algorithmic buy calls have been triggered around the 105k-108k range. While many traders have been caught in short squeezes and volatility, major liquidity zones and a potential for a bounce are highlighted. Notably, long-term holders and algorithmic signals remain bullish, and several participants explicitly call for a buy or anticipate a sharp upward move. The market is described as entering a 'buy zone' or 'entry zone' with multiple confirmations of a possible retest higher. Short-term caution is still present, but the consensus for a recovery and long opportunity is strong.",
