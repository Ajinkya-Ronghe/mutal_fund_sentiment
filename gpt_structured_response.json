    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions express bearish sentiment for BTC in the very short term, with multiple users suggesting shorting around 107,700-108,000, warnings of 'bear choke slamming these bulls', and explicit calls to 'Letâs short btc' and 'shorting at 107781'. There are some bullish mentions of a possible 108K breakout, but these are fewer and less assertive for immediate price action. No strong technical signals in chat override the prevailing short-term bearish tone.",
