    "explanation": "Despite the significant number of opinions suggesting both short and long positions, many users are highlighting the ongoing liquidation of shorts (potential short squeeze), bullish order flow, and expectations for new all-time highs. There is visible volatility and retracement, but repeated queries about 'when to buy BTC', 'BTC target', and 'TP', along with calls for holding or buying dips, indicate strong bullish sentiment. Notably, some voices point to short-term selling pressure, but the dominant narrative is that major downside liquidity has been swept and the next move is expected to be upward, reinforced by comments about new highs, bullish candlestick patterns, and post-liquidation bounces. There is also mention of external bullish catalysts (e.g., US to sell gold for BTC, Trump-related news, etc.), further supporting a high-confidence buy signal. Safe leverage is recommended due to high volatility and rapid liquidation events.",
