    "explanation": "Across a large sample of opinions, the majority sentiment for BTC is bullish, with traders expecting higher price targets (e.g. 108500, 109000, 112000, 118251, 123000) and several participants mentioning active long trades, breakout confirmations, and strong demand on dips. Positive comments cite current uptrends, new highs, and ongoing accumulation by large entities (e.g., Blackrock, MicroStrategy at $70k), as well as technical signals like RSI oversold and distribution moves suggesting buy opportunities. While there are isolated concerns about fake pumps, trap zones, and calls for profit booking or minor retracements, the overall consensus leans strongly toward continued upside, with only a few negative or neutral remarks. Many participants are asking for re-entry points and seeking leverage guidance, indicating FOMO and ongoing bullish conviction. The recommended leverage is set at 20x for isolated futures/perpetuals, as discussed by several users.",
