    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest BTC is currently in an uptrend, with several traders mentioning strong bullish momentum, key support levels holding, and expectations for further upside. Some skepticism and shorting are present, but most participants highlight buying or holding as the preferred strategy, referencing technical signals (e.g., candlestick patterns, stochastic RSI, trendlines) and broader market strength (such as tech stocks at ATH contributing to BTC bullishness). Key resistances are noted around 108k-109k, but scalpers and position traders alike are favoring long entries, with some targeting significantly higher levels in the near future.",
