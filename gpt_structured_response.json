    "explanation": "Multiple participants noted recent rejections at key resistance levels across various timeframes (1min, 5min, 15min, 1h), and expressed caution or bearishness in the short term. Discussions included views on a potential 'trap' for long traders, warnings to avoid longing until a decent retracement, and concern about overextension after recent price increases. However, a minority highlighted the broader uptrend and patience for confirmation, so there's no high conviction for a strong move either way at this moment.",
