    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions and technical observations point towards a bearish bias or at least caution for BTC in the immediate term. Key support levels (107200, 107150) are being tested, and there's mention of trendline rejection, a bear fractal, and head-and-shoulders patterns forming on higher timeframes. Several participants see downside targets (105200, 105350) if support breaks, and one notes that it's 'hard to say' with no clear bullish conviction. There is also a notable lack of sellers at lower levels, which could mean limited downside, but the range is still generally considered risky. Only minor bullish sentiment is present, with some noting support is holding for now, but the overall tone is more cautious and slightly bearish in the very short term.",
