    "explanation": "Across hundreds of live opinions, the majority sentiment is bullish or optimistic for BTC. Many users ask about holding or buying BTC, and several mention recent or ongoing long trades. Specific price targets mentioned include potential upside toward 108,500, 109,000, and even a retest of all-time highs around 110,550â111,983. Some participants express concern about short-term volatility or stop-loss hunts, but most see dips as buying opportunities, especially when BTC nears key support levels (e.g., 106,600, 107,200). Technical discussions highlight support holding, volume nodes, and Fibonacci levels as bullish triggers. Bearish comments are present but outnumbered by those calling for long positions, holding, or upward moves. A few recommend capital preservation or note short-term pullbacks, but positive and neutral views dominate.",
