    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions indicate bullish sentiment toward BTC. Many users discussed all-time highs being imminent, entries at breakout levels, and targets above 108,000, while others referenced strong trading volume and institutional buying (e.g., Metaplanet, Michael Saylor). Although some short-term pullback concerns and mentions of possible corrections exist, these are outweighed by frequent calls to buy, hold, or add to long positions, and a general expectation that BTC will reach new highs soon. Technical references such as support at moving averages and bullish chart patterns (e.g., 'cup and handle', 'engulfing weekly candle', 'order blocks') are noted, along with advice to trail stop losses and scale out profits. The overall consensus is to remain long with appropriate risk management, especially on isolated high-leverage perpetuals.",
