    "explanation": "A significant number of participants are calling for BTC to go higher, referencing current and near-future price targets around 108kâ109k and noting price action around 106,700â108,000. There are repeated mentions of taking long trades, adding on dips, and positive sentiment about reversals and bullish momentum. Multiple users discuss technical signals (trendline holding, liquidity sweeps, psychological levels) and some highlight the resilience of BTC compared to altcoins. While some mention selling or stop losses being hit, the net sentiment and most representative, actionable opinions point toward buying on the current or next dip, especially on short timeframes, with high confidence.",
