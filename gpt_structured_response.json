    "explanation": "Despite some short-term bearish opinions and volatility, the majority of sentiments and trades discussed are favoring long positions or holding existing longs. Many participants mention holding through pullbacks, expecting all-time highs, or waiting for liquidity grabs before a further upward move. There is repeated mention of bullish structure, BTC dominance, and technical setups supporting a continued run. Several users explicitly state they are long or recommend buying, and some reference bullish macro signals (liquidity, DXY dropping, QE expectations). Shorting is considered risky or contrarian by several experienced voices. The representative opinions and the overall market tone lean heavily bullish for BTC.",
