    "explanation": "BTC discussions are overwhelmingly focused on bullish long-term views, with many users referencing holding, buying dips, and the coin being 'cheap' relative to future expectations. There is a significant amount of live trade talk about entering long or holding positions, and several comments note BTC dominance and resilience compared to alts. Despite some short-term sell suggestions and a few mentioning possible short-term corrections, the overall sentiment remains strongly bullish for both intraday and higher timeframes. Many participants request buy zones, stop losses, and express FOMO about missing entries. No other coin generated as much sustained debate or strong directional conviction.",
