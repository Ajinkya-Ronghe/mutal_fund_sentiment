    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed but tilt slightly bullish. Signals include explicit long recommendations (Marticlues AI), talk of higher highs, bounce targets, and holding positions for more upside. However, there are notable short/exit calls and warnings about resistance and risky areas. The 1-minute candlestick signal is inferred as 'long' due to the Marticlues AI trade idea and several comments referencing bounces and bullish structure. Confidence is medium due to the significant number of bearish/short opinions counterbalancing bullish ones.",
