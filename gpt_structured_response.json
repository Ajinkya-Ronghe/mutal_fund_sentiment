    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed, but recent opinions indicate technical rejection at trendline and daily open levels, with downside breakout targets and bear patterns (head and shoulders, bear fractal) discussed. While some mention possible bounces, the majority focus on potential downside moves toward 105,200â105,350. Few express bullishness in the very short term, but overall the group expects more downward movement or volatility before any sustained bullish reversal. No strong bullish conviction is present.",
