    "explanation": "BTC is showing strong resilience and outperformance relative to other coins, with multiple opinions citing ongoing retail shorts being squeezed and significant ETF inflows ($588M), suggesting continued institutional demand. Despite some concerns about being overbought and short-term corrections, the prevailing sentiment is bullish, especially with key resistance levels being tested and broken (e.g., $106,500). The majority of representative traders discuss holding or adding to longs, expecting higher levels (targets towards 108,500, 109,000, and even 1 million in the long run), supported by technical factors like order blocks, Donchian channel bounces, and volume profile signals. Calls to reduce leverage and use proper risk management are frequent, but the directional bias remains strongly positive for buying BTC. Negative and neutral opinions exist (profit-taking, minor corrections, short-term shorts), but are outweighed by bullish conviction and strategic long entries.",
