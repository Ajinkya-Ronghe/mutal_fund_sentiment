    "explanation": "There is a mix of opinions with some users highlighting bullish price targets (e.g., 1102000, 107720, 109.6, 111), others mentioning market holding above key levels, and repeated requests for swing trade entries. Some skepticism exists about the current rally's sustainability, but more comments support upside potential. Technical signals such as VWAP and Ichimoku cloud confluence are mentioned. Few negative sentiments (e.g., 'false up', 'must retest support') temper the overall confidence.",
