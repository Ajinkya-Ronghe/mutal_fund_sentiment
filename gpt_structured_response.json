    "explanation": "BTC is showing strong bullish sentiment with multiple users expecting new all-time highs (ATH) and significant upward movement. Many traders reported profits from long positions, and there is ongoing FOMO (fear of missing out) in the community. AI trading signals hit multiple take-profits on BTC/USDT long trades. Despite some short scalping attempts, most community sentiment and recent trade activity point to continued bullish price action. Macro news (e.g., Powell testimony, Trump speech) is fueling volatility but is interpreted mostly as positive for BTC. Several users reference technical breakouts and major support levels being respected, with large funds accumulating in the $70k range and targets mentioned as high as 112k and above. The overall tone is optimistic for further gains.",
