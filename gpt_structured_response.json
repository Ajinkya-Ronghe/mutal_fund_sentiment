    "explanation": "Despite a highly divided sentiment with many retail traders opening shorts and some high-profile opinions calling for a dump, there is a persistent group advocating for buying dips and FOMO. Significant volatility is present, but strong interest in buying on dips and a history of rapid recoveries after dumps suggest further upside potential. Several experienced traders are actively looking for long entries, referencing key resistance levels being broken and hints at a short squeeze. There are warnings about possible traps for both longs and shorts, but the overall market structure and positive momentum, especially after key levels like $106,500 and the weekly candle above prior ATH closes, support a bullish thesis. Caution is warranted due to volatility, but the opportunity for further upside remains strong.",
