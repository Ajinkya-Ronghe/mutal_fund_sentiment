    "explanation": "A significant number of comments suggest bullish sentiment, with multiple mentions of support holding, expectations of moves towards 108,300-108,500, and calls for re-entry or holding long positions. Some users discuss bullish chart patterns like W formation, and thereâs reference to multiple green candles and price holding above moving averages. However, there is also notable caution around resistance zones, liquidation clusters, and potential for down moves after resistance, which tempers the overall confidence. The consensus leans towards a buy/long bias, especially if price stays above key supports or moving averages.",
