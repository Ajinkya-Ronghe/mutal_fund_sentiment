    "explanation": "Despite recent bearish pressure and short-term volatility, there is significant buy interest and repeated calls for 'buying the dip' around key support zones. Several participants indicated intent to re-enter or hold long positions if USDT dominance retests 5.0%, with expectations for a market pump to follow. Multiple users noted liquidity zones between 103k-106k as potential reversal areas, with several calling for a bounce after a shakeout. The overall sentiment is mixed but with a notable tilt towards buying opportunities at current or slightly lower levels, especially as the price approaches major support and psychological levels. Momentum indicators and market structure discussions also suggest a possible bullish reversal if support holds, and there is continued high engagement on BTC direction. Leverage discussions commonly cite up to 20x as safe for isolated perpetuals, matching prevailing risk appetite.",
