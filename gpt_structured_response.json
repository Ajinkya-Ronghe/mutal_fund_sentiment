    "explanation": "Across hundreds of live chat opinions, BTC is repeatedly described as the primary asset to focus on, with strong references to bullish momentum, resistance and support levels being tested, and targets above current prices. Many users mention entering or holding long BTC trades, and several reference capital preservation and upward moves after pullbacks. Some mention short-term volatility, but sentiment is dominated by expectations of a pump or a significant upward move, especially after recent consolidation and resistance testing. There is also institutional support news (Fidelity, ETF talk), and several comments advise avoiding altcoins in favor of BTC. The handful of bearish or uncertain comments are outnumbered by positive or constructive bullish signals, especially on short time frames.",
