There are multiple mentions of expected price targets around 108,000â115,000, discussions of strong support at key levels, and confirmations that the market is macro bullish. Some traders mention taking profits and re-entering on dips, while others highlight the importance of following higher timeframes (1 hour), and several affirmations to 'hold' or 'buy' BTC. Although there are a few bearish or short-side comments, the balance of representative opinions, candlestick analysis, and user sentiment is decisively tilted towards a continued upward trend with high conviction.",
