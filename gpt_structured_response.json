    "explanation": "Despite some concerns raised about hashrate drops and possible vulnerability, the overall sentiment in the live chat leans bullish. Multiple participants highlight bullish technical patterns (bullish flag, price compression, potential for explosive moves), expectations of higher targets (109k, 111k, 113k, 150k), and the difficulty shorts are facing as the price grinds upward. Concerns about network security are largely countered by others pointing out the still-strong hashrate. Several traders are actively looking for long entries or are already holding profitable long positions, and spot buying is being suggested. The prevailing trading momentum and crowd sentiment suggest a high-confidence long bias, with a safe leverage recommendation for experienced traders.",
