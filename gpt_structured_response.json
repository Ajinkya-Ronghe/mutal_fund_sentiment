    "explanation": "A significant number of participants are discussing bullish structures (inverse head and shoulders, bullish wedge, higher lows), algorithmic buy calls to 108k, and consistent references to support holding above 105k and targets up to 110k. Multiple users express intent to buy or are holding long, with only sporadic short-term selling opinions quickly countered by renewed buying sentiment. Sentiment is further reinforced by trading groups recommending long entries and retail traders asking for buy setups. Despite some volatility and stop-loss hits, the overall tone is constructive for a further push higher.",
