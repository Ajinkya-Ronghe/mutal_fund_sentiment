    "explanation": "Sentiment is currently mixed but with a tilt towards bullishness after recent volatility and support holding above key levels. Several users mention upcoming pumps, long positions, and significant targets (70-80k, even 110k). There is positive anticipation around Powell's remarks and potential rate cuts, which could be bullish for BTC. However, warnings of further dips, liquidation hunts, and ongoing volatility reduce overall confidence. The 1-minute candlestick signal is 'long' as multiple users reference real-time buying and recovery. Conservative leverage is recommended due to the large swings and recent rapid drops.",
