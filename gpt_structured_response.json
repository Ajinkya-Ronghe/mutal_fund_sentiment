    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term comments, the majority of sentiment and technical discussions for BTC in the live chat are bullish. Comments reference support holding, bounces expected, anticipation of new all-time highs, and advice to 'hold' or 'buy'. Technical mentions include support at key levels (107k, 106800), bounces off Bollinger Bands, and references to resistance breakouts on the 1-hour chart. There are some concerns about short-term volatility and bear traps, but overall, traders are discussing buying zones, holding longs, and expecting continued upward movement. No significant negative news outweighs the dominant positive sentiment. Leverage discussions suggest confidence in using higher isolated leverage products.",
