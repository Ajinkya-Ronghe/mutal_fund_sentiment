    "explanation": "A majority of opinions suggest bullish sentiment on BTC, including calls for long positions, expectations of upward movement, and technical confirmations (e.g., 'BTC upar jaane ke liye taiyar hai', 'we long only', 'BTC retest complete now going up'). However, there are also a few warnings about possible traps, sideways action, and calls for caution, which tempers the overall confidence to medium. The positive momentum is supported by mentions of weak sellers, upward targets, and market structure, while a minority suggest risk management or are undecided.",
