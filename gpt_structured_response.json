    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term opinions and calls for both pullbacks and further drops, there is strong evidence of bullish momentum and large-scale institutional inflows into BTC. Many viewers mention ETF inflows, all-time highs, and targets above current prices (108500, 109000, 120000). The overall consensus is that while pullbacks and volatility are present, the bigger picture remains bullish, with several participants recommending buy entries and holding for higher targets. Technical signals like pole flag patterns, breakouts, and indicators (RSI, MACD, EMA) point to an uptrend. The negative sentiment appears mostly short-term or based on profit taking, not a reversal of the main trend.",
