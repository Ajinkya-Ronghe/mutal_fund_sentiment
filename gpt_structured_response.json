    "explanation": "A majority of opinions point to BTC's upward price action, with recent support levels holding, market participants actively looking for long entries, and several mentions of strong bullish sentiment (e.g., 'BTC fire', 'btc long? scalp', 'Market retest kar raha ha bro.. 107200 go for long'). Technical discussion around volume nodes and resistance breakouts (e.g., 'Daily close top of this second volume node above the POC at $106,225 could very much createD a \"launch\" off this shelf up towards the all-time highs zone ranging from $110,550 up to $111,983.') indicate momentum is to the upside. Multiple users report closing successful longs or looking for new buy entries after retests. While some mention potential for short-term corrections or waiting for lower entries, the prevailing view is to buy dips and hold for higher targets. The presence of positive institutional sentiment (e.g., Fidelity note), and supportive macro (potential rate cuts) further boost confidence. Negative and neutral mentions exist but are outweighed by buy signals and bullish outlooks.",
