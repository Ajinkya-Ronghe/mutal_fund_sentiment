    "explanation": "Across the live opinions, there is strong evidence of bullish sentiment and active trading interest in BTC. Multiple users mentioned targets above the current price (e.g., 109300, 111000, 108500, 115k, and even long-term targets like 185-241k in January). Several comments referenced ongoing momentum, support levels holding (e.g., 108K new support), and users holding profitable long positions or considering to add more. There is also discussion about BTC moving with gold, and users capturing significant points on the upside. While some shorts and calls for pullbacks exist, the overall momentum, active buying, and majority of positive opinions indicate a high-confidence long signal. Representative opinions highlight active interest, new support formation, positive reactions to macro news, and aggressive upside targets.",
