    "explanation": "Despite a prevailing bearish sentiment with many opinions favoring shorts and expecting further downside (targets from 106k to 102k, calls to short at 107k and 108k, and references to high supply/liquidity zones), there are key contrarian signals and fresh buy calls: algorithmic systems have called for a buy at current levels, several users discuss the potential for a bounce or recovery, and some are mentioning significant support/bounce possibility at 106,400/105,500. Additionally, the sharp drop seems to have triggered liquidations, often preceding a relief rally. The presence of volatility, large fluctuations expected in the next 12 weeks, and references to rapid recoveries after such dumps, as well as trading bots and algorithms suggesting a buy, all point toward a high-confidence opportunity for a counter-trend long. The 1-minute candlestick action is likely to show volatility and a possible reversal to the upside.",
