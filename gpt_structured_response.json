    "explanation": "A significant number of live opinions are bullish on BTC, with multiple users discussing active or pending long trades, anticipation of liquidating shorts, and expectations of price surges. There is mention of price compression, bullish momentum, and positive market structure (e.g., 'non-stop slow climb is eating shorts alive,' 'we could have a nice bears liquidations wave,' 'BTC looking mucho fina,' 'Broke $106500 nice!'). While a few users note bearish risks due to hashrate drops and resistance zones, the majority sentiment leans toward an imminent upward move. There is also explicit discussion of leverage, with users asking about safe leverage ratios for BTC. The isolated negative opinions are outnumbered by bulls and neutrals, and several participants are actively seeking or confirming BTC buy opportunities.",
