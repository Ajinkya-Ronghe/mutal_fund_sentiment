    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions indicate bearish sentiment for BTC, with several users discussing a potential drop, a lack of bullish momentum, and specific price levels being mentioned as resistance or breakdown points (107,500â108,000). There are some bullish outliers targeting much higher prices, but these are less frequent and lack immediate technical justification. Short-term candlestick and order flow commentary (e.g., 'more down', 'Bulls are out of steam', 'bearzzzzzzzz', 'BTC drop again pretty soon') suggest a higher probability of further downside in the immediate term.",
