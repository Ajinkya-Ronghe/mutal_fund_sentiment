    "explanation": "The overall sentiment from the live chat is mixed but leans bullish in the short term for BTC. Multiple users mention support holding around 106,800â107,500, with expectations of a bounce and new highs. Several users note strong buying pressure and potential for upside moves, with references to operator activity and stop-loss hunting indicating volatility but possible upward momentum. However, there are also warnings of dumps, strong resistance at 110k+, and opinions about potential short-term retracements. The presence of both buy and sell calls, plus references to market manipulation and caution, lowers confidence from high to medium. The 1-minute candlestick sentiment is 'long' due to repeated calls of ongoing pumps, 'to the moon' comments, and specific bot/TA signals suggesting 'Buy Storm' and new highs.",
