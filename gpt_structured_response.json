    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish in the chat, with many participants discussing price breakouts above 108k, calls for holding and buying, and expectations for further upside. There is frequent mention of overcoming resistances, 'boom' moves, and celebratory mood around new highs. Multiple users are asking about new entries and leverage, with several references to safe leverage between 20x and 25x, and questions about holding long. Any short suggestions are quickly countered by bullish responses or described as liquidated. Several users specifically mention buying above 108k and expecting targets up to 110k and beyond. Representative candlestick and technical signals mentioned include breakouts, bull runs, and supply zones above current price. Although a handful of users mention possible pullbacks or short-term retracements, the positive sentiment and momentum outweigh the negatives.",
