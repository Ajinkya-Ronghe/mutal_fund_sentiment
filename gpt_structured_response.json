    "explanation": "Despite some short-term bearish voices and active short trades above 105k, the overall sentiment in the chat is strongly bullish. Many viewers are discussing successful long trades, holding for higher targets, and expressing FOMO about missing the uptrend. Several users reference upcoming resistance levels (e.g., 108500, 111k, 118251.8) as likely targets. Key influencers and general sentiment point to Bitcoin trending up, with some concern about volatility around news events but a consensus that BTC will see new highs. There is also explicit advice to avoid shorting and to use momentum strategies for long entries. The risk appetite is high, but traders repeatedly mention the importance of discipline and stop-loss management. The environment supports a leveraged long position with clear momentum, especially on lower time frames like the 1-minute candlestick.",
