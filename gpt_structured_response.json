    "explanation": "The sentiment in the live chat is predominantly bullish for BTC, with repeated calls for entry, discussion of support levels holding, and multiple users referencing upward moves and institutional inflows. There are explicit long trade signals with defined entry, TP, and SL from signal providers (e.g., Marticlues AI). Many participants are asking about safe buy zones, and several mention that Powell's remarks have given a 'green light' for Bitcoin. While a few users note short-term volatility or profit-taking, the majority expect a bounce and further upside. Technical analysis mentions confirm bullish setups (e.g., 9 green H4 candles, bullish formations, breakouts).",
