Many participants are discussing long positions, buy entries, and expectations for higher prices. Several are holding or adding to longs, and there's discussion of BTC overperforming other assets recently. The main risks discussed are potential retracements and high leverage, but the dominant view is to buy or hold BTC, especially on any dips or above key support levels.",
