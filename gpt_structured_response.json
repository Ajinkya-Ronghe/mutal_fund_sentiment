    "explanation": "Multiple participants discussed bullish technical setups for BTC, including mentions of trendline breaks, flag and pole patterns, and Fibonacci retracements projecting higher targets (e.g., 125-160k). There's strong sentiment around BTC dominance, expectations of new all-time highs, and upcoming supply shocks above 108k. Short-term volatility and range-bound price action are acknowledged, but the majority view is that dips are buying opportunities and the market structure remains bullish. Some mention potential black swan events or brief corrections, but these are outnumbered by optimistic outlooks and active buy-side trades.",
