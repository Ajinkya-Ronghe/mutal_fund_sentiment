Several users discuss the possibility of a retracement or short opportunity, referencing double tops, rejection at high weekly ranges, and warnings about trapping longs. Some mention the recent significant move up and expect a pullback, while a minority remain bullish. No consensus on a strong uptrend continuation in the immediate term; rather, more caution and short signals are present.",
