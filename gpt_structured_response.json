    "explanation": "Several participants noted BTC facing resistance and a rejection at important levels on short timeframes, including the 1-minute. There is talk of a possible trap for longs and warnings not to long until a decent retracement. Others point out a double top on the 1-hour and that BTC has gone up a lot recently. However, some see overall uptrend structure, but near-term sentiment is cautious to bearish for immediate trades.",
