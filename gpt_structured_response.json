    "explanation": "BTC received a mix of opinions but current sentiment leans bullish with many traders discussing potential long entries, support holding, and upside targets (108500, 109k, retests for bounce, and new ATH). Some noted short-term pullbacks or volatility, yet the general outlook is for further upward movement after retests, with several users actively holding or entering long trades. Positive signals include buy-side liquidity, breakout discussions, and multiple requests for BTC analysis and long signals. Negative or short opinions are present but less prevalent and countered by strong bullish calls and active trades. High leverage is considered safe by experienced traders.",
