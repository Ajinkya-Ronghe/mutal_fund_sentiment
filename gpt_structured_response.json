    "explanation": "Several participants discussed recent rejections at both micro (1m, 5m) and macro (1h) timeframes, with specific mention of failed retests, double tops, and the risk of bull traps. Multiple traders caution against longing until a retracement, and some suggest the market is primed to trap late buyers. There are also mixed but notable calls for waiting or shorting, especially after recent rapid gains. However, some bullish views remain, and certain traders mention trading ranges and possible bounces, tempering overall conviction.",
