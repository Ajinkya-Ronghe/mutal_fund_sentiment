    "explanation": "The majority of opinions and technical signals suggest short-term downward pressure on BTC. Many users mention upcoming dumps, heavy liquidity to the downside, and bearish patterns (e.g., MSS, big red candles, .382 fib retracement, 'retest down below', support at 105450, and risk of further downside to 101k, 98k, or even 93k). However, there are also a few bullish or rangebound comments, and some suggest bounce/retest at lower levels before upward movement, so confidence is not high.",
