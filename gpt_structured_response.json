Several users note 1-minute and 5-minute chart rejections, mention of potential 'trap' setups, and warnings against longing before a retracement. There are also mentions of a double top on the 1-hour chart and skepticism about immediate upward movement. However, some users are still looking for higher targets (e.g., above 107.5k), but the majority of actionable 1-minute sentiment is cautious to bearish.",
