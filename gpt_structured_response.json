    "explanation": "The sentiment around BTC is highly mixed, with a slight edge toward bullishness in the very short term. Several users report ongoing pumps, buying interest at support levels, and expectations of higher prices (targets mentioned at 109200, 120k, and even 130k). However, many also warn of resistance zones, potential reversals, and the need for caution. Some are holding long positions from around 107200, while others prefer to wait for breakouts or liquidity sweeps. News-based positive catalysts and a few strong 'buy' calls exist, but so do warnings of overextension and profit-taking. On the 1-minute chart, the momentum appears upward, but confidence is not high due to persistent selling pressure and volatility.",
