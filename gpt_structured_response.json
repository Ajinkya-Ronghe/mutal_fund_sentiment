    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is mixed but slightly tilted toward bullishness. Many users mention potential upward targets (e.g., 108000, 109000, 110000, 111000), and several ask about or recommend buying or entering long positions. Some warn of pullbacks and reversals, but there is a consistent stream of 'buy' and 'breakout' comments, alongside live reports of successful profits on long trades. Bearish opinions and warnings of correction are present but less frequent. The 1-minute candlestick sentiment appears to support a cautious long bias, but with notable volatility and risk of sudden reversals.",
