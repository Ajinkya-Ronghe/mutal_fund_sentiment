    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is highly mixed but leans short-term bearish. Multiple users discuss resistance levels (e.g., 107800, 108700), failed pumps, and calls for exit or shorting at local tops. Some expect relief drops, shakeouts, and retests. There is notable confusion and hedging behavior, with a few bullish voices regarding long-term prospects. The immediate order flow and candlestick discussion suggest a bias to the downside, with warnings about liquidity grabs and failed bullish moves. A few opinions point to possible bounces, but the majority of actionable signals relate to short entries or taking profit.",
