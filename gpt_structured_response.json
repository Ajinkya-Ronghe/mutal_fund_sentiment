    "explanation": "Multiple users are calling for upside moves, bounce entries at support, and significant bullish targets (107190, 108000, 109000, 112000, 120k, 160k). There are calls for a pump, confirmations of buy signals, and references to recent breakouts above resistance. Although some users mention potential for short-term dumps or selling pressure, the majority sentiment is strongly bullish for BTC, especially after retests and market absorption signals. The consensus is to buy dips and hold for higher prices, supported by live chart updates and references to bullish technical setups.",
