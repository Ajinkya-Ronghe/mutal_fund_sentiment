    "explanation": "The majority of BTC-specific comments indicate strong bullish sentiment and active buying interest. Multiple users mention holding, buying, or expecting significant upward movements (targets like 108328, 108500, 110k, and even 100,000+ are discussed). There is consistent mention of BTC outperforming alts, with some noting that capital is rotating from alts into BTC. Some users are cautious about uptrends and urge discipline, but the overall mood is optimistic with frequent references to support holding, successful trades, and advice not to short if BTC closes above key moving averages. Despite a few concerns about volatility, range-bound trading, and liquidation risks, the balance of opinions, especially those referencing technical setups and targets, support a high-confidence buy signal with moderate leverage.",
