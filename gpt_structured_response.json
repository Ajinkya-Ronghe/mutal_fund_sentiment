    "explanation": "Despite recent volatility, most active and experienced participants are either still holding or expressing confidence in long positions for BTC. Several users report holding from lower levels and waiting for higher targets (e.g., 107000+), and multiple mentions suggest buying or longing on dips, referencing bounces from support and bullish candlestick patterns (e.g., morning star, bullish crossovers). There is some short-term bearishness and confusion, but the dominant voices are either holding, looking for buy signals, or confirming profits on long trades. The market sentiment overall favors further upside, especially for intraday or short-term swing trades.",
