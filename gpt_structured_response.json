    "explanation": "A wide array of live comments indicate strong buyer interest in BTC around key liquidity zones (107k-109k). Several users report entering or planning to enter long trades following a bounce from support, with confirmations from both 1-hour and 15-minute bullish signals. BTC dominance is highlighted as strong, 'wrecking alts,' and institutional activity is noted. Multiple viewers ask for BTC-specific trade entries, and there are several confirmations of profit-booking and buying at these levels. Despite volatility and some negative sentiment, the majority of active traders are looking for long setups, expecting a rebound or continuation of the uptrend. Leverage discussions suggest confidence in using higher isolated leverage. The overall opinion skew is decisively bullish for BTC.",
