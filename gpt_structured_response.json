TP 108.4k', and comments implying belief in upside potential (e.g., 'there are no lower lows, itll get there'). However, some opinions point to possible short-term pullbacks before a breakout, and there is a cautious tone in several comments. Most negative comments are about taking profit or waiting for better entries, not outright bearishness.",
