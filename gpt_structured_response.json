    "explanation": "There is a mixed but slightly bullish sentiment for BTC driven by discussions of liquidity build-up, repeated calls for scalping and long positions (notably from 98k levels), and multiple mentions of BTC breaking resistance and consolidating upward. However, skepticism is present due to reports of recent large drops, lack of volume, and strong resistance zones near 108k-109k. Short-term traders emphasize the importance of daily and 1-minute closes for clear direction. The majority of voices highlight buying dips, expecting a recovery, or holding for a breakout, but several warn of possible further downside or consolidation. Leverage suggestions are generally conservative, with references to scalping and risk management.",
