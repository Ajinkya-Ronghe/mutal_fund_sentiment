    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed, but there is a notable short-term bearish sentiment based on comments suggesting BTC is facing rejection zones (107888 FVG, 916 rejection, 'down', 'trapping chalu hai', 'sideways', and calls to short). Some suggest a bounce or longer-term upward movement if certain levels break, but near-term consensus leans toward caution or shorting, especially with mentions of attempted shorts and a lack of volume.",
