    "explanation": "There is a mix of bullish and bearish sentiment, but the majority of recent chat comments lean toward buying BTC now or expecting a bounce to higher levels (120kâ130k). Several users discuss placing buy orders, holding for higher targets, and a few mention positive technical signs like RSI breakout. However, there are also notable warnings about potential dumps and resistance at 108k, which tempers overall confidence.",
