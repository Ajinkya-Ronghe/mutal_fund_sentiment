Multiple users mentioned holding or adding to long positions, and algorithmic/AI bot commentary highlighted breakout and upward trends. Despite isolated calls to short, the overwhelming direction is up, with sentiment supported by candlestick and technical patterns (e.g., EMA curling up, W formation, measured move).",
