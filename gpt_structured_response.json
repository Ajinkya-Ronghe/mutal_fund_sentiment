    "explanation": "There are mixed opinions, but several users express bullish sentiment for BTC with mentions of upcoming rises to $120k, $130k, and even $1m. Some warn of short-term weakness or drops (e.g., 106800, 107500 crash risk), but the overall tone leans bullish especially for longer-term and trend-following strategies. 1-minute chart links are shared, indicating active scalping/buying interest. Negative opinions and warnings of a drop are present, but the buying sentiment and talk of 'money flow still thick in the green' slightly outweigh the bearish calls.",
