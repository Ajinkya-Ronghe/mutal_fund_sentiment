    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "A strong majority of recent live opinions, signals, and chat comments indicate bullish momentum, with many referencing active or planned long positions, expectations of a near-term pump, confirmation of higher lows and support holding, and references to buy signals from technical analysis tools. Multiple traders mention buying, scalping long, or expecting a bounce from current levels. Some algorithmic/AI signals also point to a bullish breakout with defined targets and stop losses. News sentiment and institutional inflow speculation are supporting positive outlooks. Few negative or neutral comments were present regarding BTC itself, with most short comments being cautious or about missing entries, not trend reversals.",
