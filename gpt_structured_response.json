    "explanation": "The overall sentiment reflects mixed short-term opinions, but the majority of recent 1-minute and 4-hour chart references highlight bullish signals such as W pattern formation, bullish channel, EMA 9 daily candle above, and trend continuation. However, there are also several bearish and short calls, so confidence is not high. A number of participants recommend buying or scalp buying, referencing uptrend, gap fill to upside, and strong support levels. Risk management and quick profit booking are advised due to volatility.",
