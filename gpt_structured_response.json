    "explanation": "Despite a significant amount of bearish and indecisive sentiment among traders, BTC continues to grind higher with strong bullish structure on higher time frames. There is notable mention of big investors, bullish targets (110k, 117k, 120k, 130k), and repeated requests for entry points and holding strategies. While shorts are popular, many treat shorting as risky, and several comments mention holding, buying, or targeting higher prices. Some traders note potential for a healthy correction, but overall sentiment is mixed with a bullish bias for new entries, especially after the 106,500 level breakout. The high leverage environment and perpetual future trading are discussed, with general consensus that a 20x isolated future is a reasonable safe leverage for BTC.",
