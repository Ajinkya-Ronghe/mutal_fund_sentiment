    "explanation": "Multiple users reference BTC forming bullish chart patterns (W pattern, bullish candles, 'buyers strong'), and discuss entering or re-entering long trades around support levels like 106,800â107,600. There are also several confirmations of 'long' signals and expectations for upward movement if resistance is broken. However, some users express caution about short-term volatility, liquidations near 105k, and mention of order blocks and resistance zones, indicating some mixed sentiment and choppy price action. There is enough positive momentum and interest in long trades, but also notable warnings, so confidence is set to medium.",
