    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is overall bullish based on multiple live chat opinions: several participants discuss holding or entering long positions, mention breaking key levels ($106,500), and expect further upside due to bullish technicals and macro factors like tech stock rallies and easing war risk. Some are confirming scalping longs on uptrend signals and high leverage is actively discussed. While a few express caution about short-term dips or potential retracements, the majority are looking for long entries, holding profitable longs, or asking about holding rather than exiting. The consensus leans towards buying or holding with confidence, especially with signals of momentum and strength from both technicals (EMA, stochastics, uptrend structure) and event-driven news.",
