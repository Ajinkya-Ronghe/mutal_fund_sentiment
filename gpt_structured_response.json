    "explanation": "BTC is widely discussed with an overall bullish sentiment. There are repeated calls to buy and hold, multiple users referencing long-term profitability, and many citing macro bullish news and a perception that BTC remains undervalued compared to future prices. While some users discuss short-term corrections or pullbacks, most believe these are opportunities to accumulate more. Comments emphasize the resilience of BTC, its divisibility, historical performance, and expected future gains. Additionally, technical references to breaking trends, positive dominance, and retests after breakouts suggest strong immediate and mid-term buying interest. There are very few strong negative opinions, and most of the neutral or cautionary views are around short-term volatility, not the overall trend.",
