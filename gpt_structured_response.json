    "explanation": "Despite some bearish sentiment and active shorting, there are multiple calls for BTC buy/swing trades, profit booking on shorts, and expectations for upside moves (e.g., 108500 target, bouncebacks). Many discuss healthy corrections and short squeezes, but the overall momentum and trader interest suggest a strong buy signal, especially for intraday or swing positions. Numerous entries are reported as active, and several users ask for upside targets and trade confirmations, indicating positive trader sentiment. Short-term volatility is high, but the broader consensus supports the long side, especially with market structure and pivot levels being tested.",
