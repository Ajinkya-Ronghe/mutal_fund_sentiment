    "explanation": "There is a predominance of negative sentiment regarding BTC in the live chat. Multiple users mention selling, shorting, or expecting further price drops around key levels (e.g., 108500, 109k, 106500, 104k). Repeated comments reference manipulation, stop-loss hunting, and a bearish or sideways bias. Some expect a bounce if daily closes above 107k, but the immediate consensus leans bearish with discussions about failed longs, stop-losses, and market exhaustion.",
