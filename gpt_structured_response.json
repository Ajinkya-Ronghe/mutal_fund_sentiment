    "explanation": "Multiple participants discuss the possibility of BTC dropping to lower levels (105,000â105,350), noting triangle and symmetrical patterns, potential bear fractal/head-and-shoulders on higher timeframes, and a lack of strong bullish conviction. However, some also mention the possibility of a bounce from current support or after a drop, suggesting a choppy or indecisive short-term environment. The consensus leans slightly bearish for the immediate next move.",
