    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions express strong bullish sentiment, with repeated references to 'longs', targets above current price levels (e.g. 108k, 156k, 200k), and emotional exuberance. Some warnings of greed and possible bull traps are present, but positive momentum and expectation of further upward movement dominate. Technical mentions of triangle breakout, specific long entries, and macro commentary on DXY weakness reinforce the bullish bias.",
