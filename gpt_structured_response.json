Multiple users mention price action being 'maddening', expecting further downside, discussing support breakdowns, and referencing historical dumps. There are a few speculative mentions of bounces, but overall, the tone is cautious with more references to downward movement and volatility. There are no clear bullish signals or sustained buy enthusiasm.",
