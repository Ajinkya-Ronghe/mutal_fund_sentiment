    "explanation": "The opinions are mixed, but there is a notable bias towards selling or caution in the short term. Multiple users mention strong selling, price not going down further, or market being in a downtrend, while others ask about short entries or express concerns about breakouts and support testing. A few users suggest waiting or that the market is choppy/sideways, further reducing confidence in a clear buy signal. However, some users mention holding or looking for re-entry, which slightly offsets the bearishness.",
