    "explanation": "The majority of recent live opinions reflect bullish sentiment for BTC, citing factors such as consolidation above key levels (106500+), ongoing uptrend momentum, influence from bullish tech stocks, and anticipation of further upward movement toward 108k-110k. Several participants discussed successful long entries, with some noting that breaking above resistance could lead to new all-time highs. Short-term dips are mentioned but are generally seen as opportunities for long entries, and overall risk sentiment remains positive with many seeking to hold or enter longs. The technical signals (e.g., 13/50 EMA, stochastics) and macro news like the Fed's supportive comments on crypto activities further reinforce the bullish case. While some caution around potential pullbacks and manipulation exists, the dominant view supports continued upward movement for BTC.",
