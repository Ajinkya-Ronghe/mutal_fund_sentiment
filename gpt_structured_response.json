    "explanation": "The majority of opinions suggest waiting or booking partial profits, but there are several bullish signals: mentions of potential breakouts, trendline bounces, and MACD about to turn bullish. Some mixed short-term uncertainty is present, but overall sentiment leans toward upward price action, especially if key levels hold (107,000 area). The short-term candlestick signal is 'long' due to these technical references and bullish anticipation.",
