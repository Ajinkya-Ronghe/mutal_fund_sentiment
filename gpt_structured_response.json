    "explanation": "Multiple participants referenced a sudden drop, bearish momentum, and expectations of further decline for BTC in the short term. Comments include 'The Crash Soon!!', 'The Crash is here', 'The massacre is here', 'Waterfall', 'key target is 109000 and 106400', 'below 106400 is 104400', and 'downtrend is actually starting now, not enough volume yet though.' While some noted key support and possible bounces, the overall sentiment is leaning bearish for immediate price action. However, there is also mention of manipulative support and potential for recovery, moderating the confidence.",
