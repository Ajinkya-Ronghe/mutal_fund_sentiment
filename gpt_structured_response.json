    "explanation": "Multiple participants express bullish sentiment, with many stating they are holding or entering long positions and expecting new highs (e.g. 108500, 109k, 110k, 112k, 115000). BTC dominance and chart structure are seen as intact and bullish by several traders. While there are short-term fluctuations and some mention of traps or minor pullbacks, the overall consensus is strong for further upside. Many are waiting for breakouts, and several mention not shorting in this market. The fund flows, dominance, and macro context (bull market, high liquidity, etc.) all add to the conviction.",
