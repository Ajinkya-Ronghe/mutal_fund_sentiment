MrSubmariner76 warns of a big drop, and there is talk of potential rejection and a triangle formation around 107,700. Technical analysis references, including symmetrical patterns and possible bear fractal/head & shoulders on higher timeframes, indicate short-term downside risk. However, several also note strong support zones and possible bounce targets, so the confidence is not high.",
