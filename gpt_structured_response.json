    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions indicate bullish sentiment for BTC. Multiple users reference holding or entering long positions, expecting higher price moves (e.g., 'WE PUMP ONLY WE LONG ONLY', 'BTC TP 118251,8', 'Paper BTC holders are going to DRIVE THIS UP LIKE A ROCKET', 'BTC up hi jaa raha hai', 'hole hole BTC up hi jaa raha hai'). There are also references to breaking resistance (e.g., 'Broke $106500 nice! Itâs BTC time'), and widespread FOMO is mentioned. Some participants mention caution or minor corrections, but these are outnumbered by bullish and FOMO-driven comments. No strong consensus for a major downside, and several technical traders are waiting for buy signals or confirmation of uptrend continuation. The presence of short-term shorts does not outweigh the overall bullish mood and expectation for higher highs.",
