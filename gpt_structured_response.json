    "explanation": "The sentiment is mixed but leaning bearish for BTC in the immediate term. Multiple comments suggest expectation of further downside, with references to failed breakouts, liquidity sweeps triggering stop losses, and traders planning short entries near resistance zones (109-110k). Some highlight that shorts 'are easier,' and others note weak volume and sideways/choppy price action. There are also warnings about manipulative moves and that BTC often plays within its day high/low. However, some bullish or neutral opinions exist, and a few are waiting for confirmation or a daily close to decide, hence the confidence is medium.",
