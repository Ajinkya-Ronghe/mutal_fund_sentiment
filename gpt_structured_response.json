    "explanation": "The prevailing sentiment is bullish, with several mentions of breakouts on higher timeframes (4h, daily), expectations for new highs, and positive momentum. There are repeated references to bullish patterns, breakouts above resistance, and the narrative that BTC is leading the market. However, some caution is noted due to resistance zones near 108k-109k and volatility around those levels. There are also a few short-term bearish mentions and calls for consolidation, but the majority opinion is constructive for BTC in the near term if key resistance is broken.",
