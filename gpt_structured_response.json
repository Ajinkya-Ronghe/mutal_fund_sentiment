    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Despite a heavy mix of short and bearish sentiment, there is significant evidence of strong buying pressure, bullish technical signals (e.g., cup and handle, bullish reversal, and higher targets), and multiple calls for 'BTC boom' and 'all time high' levels. Several users reported success with long positions, and there are signs of large investors moving funds onto exchanges, potentially signaling institutional accumulation. Key resistance and liquidity zones are being tested, and market participants expect a pullback followed by another upward move. Macro factors, such as Federal Reserve comments and spot buying, are also contributing to the bullish outlook. The negative voices are either short-term or based on fear, while the longer-term sentiment and technicals remain positive.",
