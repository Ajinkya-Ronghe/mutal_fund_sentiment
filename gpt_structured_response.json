    "explanation": "The overall sentiment leans bullish with several users noting trendline support, accumulation, and upside potential. Some recommend holding as long as price stays above key support levels (e.g., 106800, trendline, last red candle's low). There are also multiple mentions of sharp reversals, patience for upside, and scalping for profit. However, a few users warn about traps, operator games, and possible downside if support breaks, contributing to medium (not high) confidence. Representative candlestick/TA comments support a bullish short-term view.",
