    "explanation": "Despite bearish signals, there is a continued stream of positive sentiment around buying BTC for the long term, with multiple users advocating for dollar-cost averaging, holding, or viewing dips as buying opportunities. Several users express a belief in BTC's eventual recovery and growth, referencing targets as high as 122k or 180k, and a general sentiment that 'BTC is gold.' This is balanced by the current short-term uncertainty and volatility.",
