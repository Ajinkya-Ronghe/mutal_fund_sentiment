    "explanation": "Sentiment for BTC is broadly bullish based on several representative opinions. BTC is outperforming the market, breaking through resistance levels (notably $106,500), and there is strong interest in long positions. Key technicals such as the 4hr and 1hr order blocks around 108,642 are highlighted as potential entry points. The ETF inflow and positive news around a ceasefire have provided market relief and upward momentum. Multiple comments indicate buy signals, suggestions to long, and expectations for further rallies toward new highs. While some mention potential corrections, the majority lean bullish with swing and long-term targets above current levels. There is also a strong emphasis on using lower leverage for safety, with advice against extreme leverage (e.g., 75x).",
