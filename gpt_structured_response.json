    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate bearish or cautious sentiment for BTC. Comments mention price drops due to fresh supply from mining, increased liquidations, and technical analysis pointing to lower targets (e.g., 105300 from a symmetrical drop, support lines at 106.5-107200, and unfavorable 4hr charts). While a few users are looking for a 'bounce' or potential long at lower prices (e.g., 103k), the dominant tone is negative or uncertain, suggesting a short-term bearish outlook.",
