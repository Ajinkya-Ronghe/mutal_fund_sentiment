    "explanation": "Across the live chat, sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish for BTC. Multiple users mention BTC breaking key resistance levels (107868, 108900, 109000, 109521), targets toward 109300, 112k, and even 123k, and strong upward moves. Many are asking about re-entry on dips, holding through volatility, and discuss being stopped out of shorts or booking partial profits but still expecting higher. There is also direct mention of volume bursts, FOMO, and that BTC is 'pumping' while alts lag. Even uncertainty and some short attempts are quickly met with comments about the dominant bullish trend and recommendations to 'hold' or 'long.'",
