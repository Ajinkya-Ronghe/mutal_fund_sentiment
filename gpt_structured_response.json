    "explanation": "Despite some concerns about hashrate and potential pullbacks, the majority of live chat sentiment is bullish on BTC, with multiple users discussing targets above 110k, new all-time highs, and strong market momentum. Many are asking when to buy or confirming they are already long. The few negative or neutral opinions are outweighed by the prevalence and conviction of bullish statements. A safe leverage of up to 20x is suggested due to the overall optimism, but caution is warranted as volatility remains high and some expect short-term corrections.",
