    "explanation": "Multiple participants discuss ongoing accumulation, positive long-term price projections (e.g., '1 Million is just a matter of time', '120k end of June'), and news/rumors about institutional buying (e.g., 'White House to buy Bitcoin', 'accumulation plan'). Community sentiment is generally bullish, with calls to buy on dips and DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategies, while some warn of volatility and urge caution around key support/resistance levels. There is some uncertainty and recognition of volatility in the short term, but no dominant negative narrative.",
