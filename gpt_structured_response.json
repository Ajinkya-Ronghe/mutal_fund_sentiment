    "explanation": "Despite high volatility and mixed short-term opinions, the majority of actionable sentiment for BTC is positive or anticipating a bounce after a recent drop. Several live traders have expressed intent to long BTC at key liquidity levels (105k, 104k support), while others highlight that the downside pressure is likely exhausted as alts may start to run and BTC is expected to stabilize or pump. There is notable consensus around entering longs on confirmation, and many see the current price action as a shakeout before a larger move up. High leverage is suggested as 'safe' in community context, but should be managed prudently due to volatility.",
