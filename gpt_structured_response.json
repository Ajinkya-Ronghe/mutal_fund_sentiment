    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat for BTC is bullish with multiple mentions of successful long scalps, expectations for higher targets (e.g., 108,500, 112,000, 118,251), references to a 'pump', and positive technical signals indicated by Marticlues AI's bot (multiple 'Long Boom TP' hits for BTC/USDT). Despite some participants holding shorts or expressing caution about corrections, the volume of bullish and FOMO-driven commentary outweighs the negatives. The presence of short squeezes, higher high formations, and market participants eagerly watching for further upside confirms robust buying interest and momentum. Notably, institutional accumulation around $70k, expectations of new ATH, and the generally positive outlook further support a high-confidence long signal. Leverage discussions also suggest traders are comfortable with higher isolated leverage.",
