    "explanation": "The majority of opinions about BTC are strongly bullish, referencing breakouts, bull flags, and expectations of higher targets (e.g. 120-130). There is a clear sentiment that the price action is bullish unless a trend change occurs. Multiple users refer to checking all time frames, respecting triangles, and monitoring for confirmed breakouts. Some mention large sell walls and the need for caution, but the general tone is positive with references to rocket moves and 'moon time.' No significant or repeated negative sentiment is observed for BTC.",
