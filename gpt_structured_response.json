    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed, with some participants noting strong hands and a stable price, but more sentiment leans towards downside due to low volume, high open interest suggesting a likely correction, repeated comments about shorting from 108k, and many expecting a downward move. Few bullish remarks exist, but negative/short-side signals dominate the 1-minute context. Leverage should be kept low due to uncertainty and medium confidence.",
