    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions and trade calls for BTC indicate short positions or caution, with several users mentioning expected retests to lower support zones (e.g., 105k, 103k, 101k), short entries, and warnings about a possible downside or correction. Some bullish opinions exist, but negative/neutral sentiment outweighs the positive. There is also a focus on waiting for daily closes before making bullish trades, suggesting indecision and risk of further downside. The immediate short-term trend appears weak or sideways with a bias for further retracement.",
