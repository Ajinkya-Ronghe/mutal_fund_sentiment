    "explanation": "Despite some mixed short-term sentiment and warnings of manipulation, there are multiple mentions of demand zone bounces, buy signals, and algorithmic trade recommendations for long entries (e.g. Marticlues AI long signal at 107457.68). Sentiment is cautious due to volatility and resistance near 108k, but there is also talk of accumulation, uptrend continuation, and macro targets up to 120k+. The overall short-term bias appears skewed toward buying dips or holding, with a focus on managing risk due to expected fluctuations.",
