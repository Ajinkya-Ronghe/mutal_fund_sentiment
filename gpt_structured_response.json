    "explanation": "Despite some mixed short-term opinions and the presence of profit-taking and shorting activity, the overall sentiment in the live chat leans bullish for BTC. Many participants discuss buying opportunities, ask for buy entries, and express confidence in further upward movement. Technical levels like support at 106,500 and 105,000 are highlighted as strong, and several users mention holding or entering long positions around 106,000â107,000. The presence of bullish formations (falling wedge, bullish news), grid bots delivering profits, and repeated calls for buy/entry signals further reinforce the upward bias. The short-term volatility and liquidations noted by some are typical for BTC, but do not outweigh the overall long bias in live consensus. Leverage discussions indicate comfort with isolated futures up to 20x among the community.",
