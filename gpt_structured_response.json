    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions suggest bullish sentiment for BTC, with mentions of price targeting higher levels (e.g., 109700, 'next leg up', 'go north'), and key supports holding (107 as strong support). There is some caution around resistance levels and large sell orders, but overall, the crowd expects a move up to liquidation levels before any major correction. However, mixed comments about shorting and warnings to use stop-losses indicate that the confidence is not extremely high and that volatility should be expected.",
