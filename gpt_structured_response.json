    "confidence": "medium",
    "explanation": "The sentiment around BTC is mixed but slightly leans bullish due to repeated mentions of price targets above current levels (e.g., 108172, 114k, 120k, 122k), references to 'BTC season', and expectations for new all-time highs. There are also mentions of big fluctuations and the need to be 'alert in the next 12 weeks', suggesting both volatility and opportunity. The presence of both bullish and bearish comments in the community indicates uncertainty, hence a medium confidence.",
