    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Despite significant volatility and mixed retail sentiment (many shorting or expecting a dump), strong institutional activity and frequent references to big investors, FOMO, and liquidity grabs suggest a potential for upward momentum. Several users report profit from longs, highlight resistance breakouts, and note bullish signals on higher timeframes. The presence of sharp wicks, short squeezes, and repeated calls for BTC entry or buy, alongside isolated mentions of consolidation and bullish weekly candles, supports a high-confidence long bias. The overall market psychology is stressed but opportunistic, with many retail shorts potentially fueling further upward moves if a squeeze occurs.",
