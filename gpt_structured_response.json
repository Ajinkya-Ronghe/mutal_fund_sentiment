    "explanation": "Sentiment across multiple participants leans bullish for BTC, with many referencing liquidity grabs, long-term bullishness, and potential all-time highs. Several are waiting for buy signals or advocating to 'buy soon' and expect a bounce or bullish movement after liquidity sweeps. While there are some mentions of short-term volatility and stop losses being hit, the overall expectation is for BTC to continue upward after minor pullbacks. Macro factors, such as Powell's testimony and large spot buying, are also seen as supportive. Shorting is mostly discouraged at these levels, with advice to only short above 110,000. The 1-minute chart is referenced by multiple users as forming higher highs.",
