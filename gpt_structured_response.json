    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment for BTC, with several users citing successful long trades, expectations for upward movement, and technical signals for potential further gains. There is mention of key resistance levels (108k-109k) with some expecting short opportunities there, but most live commentary reflects long positioning and optimism for breakouts above recent highs. Macro factors such as potential rate cuts and ETF progress are also seen as bullish for BTC. The few short/neutral calls are outweighed by both the volume and conviction of bullish traders, especially on shorter timeframes. Therefore, the aggregated signal is a high-confidence 'Buy', with safe leverage up to 20x for isolated perpetual futures as commonly discussed in the chat.",
