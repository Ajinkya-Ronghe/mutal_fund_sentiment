    "explanation": "Despite some short-term volatility and mixed retail sentiment, the majority of high-frequency comments and trader requests lean bullish on BTC. Multiple messages reference holding or entering buy positions, anticipation of higher targets (e.g., 104,200, 105k, 107,700, 108,500), and requests for long-term buy trades. There is significant interest in buying dips and holding for recovery, with several users explicitly asking for buy entries and expressing trust in upward movement. Short-side comments are present but less frequent and often mention only short-term liquidations or 'traps.' The overall tone is bullish, with many looking for a bounce or continuation upward, and high engagement on requests for buy signals. The market appears to be absorbing liquidity at support with expectations of a move towards higher resistance zones.",
