    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed, but there are more upward predictions (e.g., calls for $120k and $130k, 'BTC time', 'fly soon', and 'Buy wins mode in on'), and some suggest the market is still holding key support ($104k, $106.5k). However, several warn of a possible big drop or high volatility near resistance ($107k-$108k), and there are visible short recommendations and concerns about absorption/exhaustion. The consensus leans more positive in the short-term, with significant bullish sentiment from retail, but notable caution regarding volatility and resistance.",
