    "explanation": "Despite a large amount of retail shorting and some participants expressing bearishness or short positions, several experienced traders highlight retail being on the wrong side of the trade and the potential for a squeeze higher. Technical analysis references, such as order blocks at 108,642 and bullish RSI signals on higher timeframes, suggest upward momentum. There is consensus that as long as BTC holds above key levels (106,500 and 107,250), a move toward 108,500-109,000 and potentially higher is likely. ETF inflows, long-term holding sentiment, and market structure shifts further support a bullish bias. However, there are also calls for trailing stop losses and taking profits at resistance, so risk management is important. The overall positive-to-negative sentiment ratio is weighted toward bullish continuation.",
