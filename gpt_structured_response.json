    "explanation": "Despite concerns about a temporary hashrate drop and some warnings of possible short-term pullbacks, the majority sentiment is bullish for BTC. Multiple participants expect higher targets (109k, 111k, 112k, 120k, 123k), and there is a consensus that the price compression and sideways action is setting up for a breakout. Several traders explicitly recommend buying for the long-term and highlight that shorts are being squeezed. Only a few voices warn of traps or false breakouts, but these are outweighed by the many bullish and buy-side arguments.",
