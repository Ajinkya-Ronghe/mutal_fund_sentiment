    "explanation": "Despite a highly mixed sentiment in the chat, with both bullish and bearish targets shared, the dominant tone among recent and influential comments leans toward bullish recovery, upside moves, and buying on dips. Multiple users discuss high targets (over 100k, 120k, even 600k), and there are several calls for entries, holding, and alerts to upcoming big moves. Some traders mention taking small profits or booking gains, but many are waiting for a larger bullish move. A few prominent voices recommend buying, with algorithmic and manual signals suggesting long entries at current or slightly lower levels. Although there are shorts and talk of volatility, the most actionable consensus from the crowd is to position for an upside move with high risk control.",
