    "explanation": "Despite some mixed short-term opinions and volatility, the overall sentiment remains positive for BTC. Many comments highlight strong historical gains, confidence in long-term holding, and the belief that Bitcoin is still early in its growth. Numerous traders reported profits, major purchases (houses, PCs), and strong community encouragement to 'go long.' Some technical voices mention support levels and buying opportunities after liquidity sweeps. While there are a few voices calling for short-term pullbacks or caution due to recent downward moves or failed stop-losses, the depth and frequency of bullish, long-term, and buy-side opinions strongly outnumber bearish or neutral calls. There is also notable repeated interest in buying dips and holding through volatility, with little actionable fear about macro events like Powell/Fed statements. The dominant crowd recommendation is to buy or hold BTC, with some advocates suggesting high leverage and isolated perpetuals for experienced traders.",
