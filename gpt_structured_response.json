Multiple users mention sell signals, support breaks, and lower targets (e.g., 106000, 105450, 103000), while some remain bullish or mention possible bounces. The market is described as 'choppy', with several opinions noting heavy liquidity to the downside, bear flags, and a preference for waiting for confirmation. There are also repeated warnings to use stop-losses and trade with caution.",
