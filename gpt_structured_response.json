    "explanation": "Across the live chat, there is strong consensus for upward BTC movement, with multiple calls for buying, holding, and going long (e.g., 'btc 107526 se long kia ha maam', 'deepu Ji: going up side', 'BTC 108500 tak jaega', 'Ashis Lama: btc abhi upar jayga'). Some mention profit-taking and SL hits, but the overall sentiment is bullish as retail shorts are said to be trapped and many expect a move to the 108,500-110,000 range before any significant correction. Several traders report entering long positions or planning to, and observers note 'plenty of room to the upside' with a pending supply/zone target at 108.7k. There are warnings about traps for both buyers and sellers, but the dominant actionable signal is a confident long/buy setup, especially for intraday/futures strategies. Leverage discussion in chat suggests up to 20x is considered reasonable and common for isolated perpetual futures.",
