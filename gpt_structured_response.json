    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term sentiment and volatility, the majority of recent opinions highlight strong buying interest on dips, anticipation of bullish breakouts, and support at key levels. Multiple users mention waiting for a long entry when USDT dominance hits certain thresholds, strong resistance holding, and a general bias towards continued upward movement. Caution is advised for short positions at current levels; a retest and breakout to higher targets is expected by several stream participants. Notable support at 106200 and the view that price could trend towards 120k further boosts bullish confidence. The consensus is to buy on dips, use technical confirmation, and maintain high but isolated leverage due to volatility.",
