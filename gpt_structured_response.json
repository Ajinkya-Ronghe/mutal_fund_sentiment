    "explanation": "BTC continues to dominate trader discussions, with many expressing confidence in holding or buying at current levels. Multiple comments suggest bullish targets (e.g., 108328 confirmed, buy side trades open, expectations of upside from 107200, and anticipation of new all-time highs in the next 12 days). While there is some short-term uncertainty and mentions of sideways or choppy action, the overall sentiment leans bullish with significant support for holding or entering long positions. Leverage use is frequently discussed, and high leverage (20x+) is considered reasonable by several experienced traders. Negative sentiment and fear are present but outweighed by optimism and buying pressure.",
