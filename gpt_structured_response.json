    "explanation": "The overall sentiment has a mild bullish tilt with several calls for booking profits after pumps, a âbull flagâ mention, speculation of a new all-time high, and technicals suggesting support-level bounces. However, there is also notable caution about manipulation, possible short-term pullbacks, and liquidation risks above certain levels. Many are trading around trendline breaks and key levels (107k, 108k), with some expecting a move up after short-term dips. The crowd has not reached a strong consensus, but short-term long setups are favored if risk-managed.",
