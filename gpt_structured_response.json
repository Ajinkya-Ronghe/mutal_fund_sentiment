    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is bullish on BTC, with multiple participants forecasting new highs (targets of 108.8k, 109k, 111k, 113k, 115k, and even 118k) and discussing strong buying, bullish momentum, and holding positions. Technical signals and candlestick patterns (e.g., buyers not breaking swing lows, 'big beautiful candle', EMA and RSI confirmations, and liquidity grabs) support a continued uptrend. There are some mentions of short-term pullbacks and scalp shorts, but the majority of voices, especially on small timeframes, are expecting further upward movement before any meaningful correction. Representative comments also note large buy volumes, bullish structure, and the potential for all-time highs.",
