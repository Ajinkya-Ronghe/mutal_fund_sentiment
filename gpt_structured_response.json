    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is highly mixed but with notable bullish signals on lower timeframes. There are strong indications of imminent volatility and potential for sharp upward movement, especially after liquidity grabs and seller traps. Several users mention order blocks and demand zones near current levels, suggesting institutional buying. Positive signals include live trading discussions, calls for focus on BTC, mentions of strong historical moves after drawdowns, and a recent large bullish transfer to Binance. While some warn of quick dumps and heavy selling above 108,700, the overall consensus leans toward a strategic buy with careful risk management and isolated leverage. The community expects up to 2-3k moves soon, and many are requesting buy entry points and indicating current or planned long positions. Macro news (Powell/Trump) adds volatility but does not change the underlying technical setups.",
