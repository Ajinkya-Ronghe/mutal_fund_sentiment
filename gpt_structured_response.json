    "explanation": "Multiple participants referenced BTC's bullish structure, with discussion of breaking key resistance levels (e.g., $106,500, $107,000, $108,000), a strong uptrend on 15m/4h timeframes, and confirmation from technical indicators such as the 4h moneyflow flipping green and stochastic RSI turning up. Despite some short-term traders expressing caution or taking shorts for scalps, the prevailing sentiment is that BTC is in a bullish phase, supported by positive correlation with tech stocks and expectations for new highs. Many community members are holding longs or looking for entries on dips.",
