    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions related to BTC are bullish or suggest imminent upward movement, with several users expressing intent to 'go long', buy, or expecting higher targets (e.g., 108500, 109000, 115k). There are calls to focus on BTC over other coins, repeated confirmations of bullish setups on different timeframes, and confidence in BTC's momentum. While a few users express caution or discuss past losses, the prevailing sentiment is optimistic, with discussions on retest entries, trendline breaks, and leveraging for profit. The technical discussions reference support levels, Fibonacci retracements, and breakout potential, further supporting a 'Buy' recommendation with high confidence.",
