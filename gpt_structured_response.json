    "explanation": "The majority of opinions anticipate bullish price action, referencing an ascending triangle breakout, targets above previous all-time highs (108K, 109K, 120K), and several remarks about sideways consolidation as a setup for higher moves. While a minority predict rejections or drops to 90K or 103K, positive sentiment outweighs negative, especially regarding medium-term moves. The overall tone is optimistic, but there is notable caution regarding resistance levels and fakeouts.",
