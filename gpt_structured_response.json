    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate a bullish bias for BTC with multiple participants mentioning long positions, expectations of new all-time highs, and strong chart structure. Some are targeting 109k-115k, with anticipation of a breakout or rally fueled by spot buying and macro bullish factors (bond yields dropping, liquidity increasing, DXY dropping). Despite a vocal minority expressing short-term caution or holding shorts, the balance of sentiment and technical commentary favors a long bias, especially on low timeframes. There is high engagement in 1-minute and short timeframe analysis, with several traders holding longs from lower levels and expecting further upside. Risks remain due to volatility and the presence of some contrarian shorts, but overall long conviction is higher.",
