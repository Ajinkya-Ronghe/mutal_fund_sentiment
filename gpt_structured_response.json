    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is strongly bullish based on multiple live opinions referencing breakouts above key resistance (notably $106,500), expectations of new all-time highs, and technical indicators like stochastics pushing into bullish zones. While some warn of possible retracements or liquidity sweeps, the majority support further upside, especially as tech stocks are also bullish and triggers for a rally are aligned. Scalping longs and holding for higher targets (up to 112,000 and beyond) are actively discussed. Leverage should be used with caution, but 20x isolated futures are considered safe by most active traders in this context.",
