    "explanation": "Several participants mentioned rate cuts as bullish for BTC, with references to buyer panic and dip buying. Multiple comments suggest upward movement (e.g., 'BTC 109.2 becomes support we rippin', 'the longer the price hangs out below local high and creeps up with rsi, the likelier we go higher', 'RSI is too low', 'Nice time to buy some BTC', 'BTC donât miss it'). Despite minor mentions of confusion and possible short-term support retests, overall sentiment is positive and expects higher prices.",
