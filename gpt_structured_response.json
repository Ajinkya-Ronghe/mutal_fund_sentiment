    "explanation": "Despite a mix of short-term bearish and bullish sentiment, there is significant support for upward momentum, with frequent mentions of targets above 108k, expectations of further pumps, and multiple requests for buy/entry signals. Notably, live price action is volatile, but many traders anticipate a bounce or continuation upwards after corrections. Several also discussed the value of small stop losses and large profits, supporting managed risk with high leverage. Temporary dumps are seen as liquidity grabs rather than trend reversals. There is an ongoing debate about short-term traps and fakeouts, but the overall crowd leans toward bullish continuation with rapid recoveries.",
