While some warn of a potential pullback and significant short interest, multiple users reference the price pushing higher and shorts being 'burned.' The Marticlues AI bot issued a WBTC/USDT long signal, which is a BTC derivative. However, caution is warranted as some users anticipate a pullback or advise to wait before entering.",
