    "explanation": "The overall sentiment is mixed, but there are notable bullish signals, including calls for aggressive long positions near 98k and 100k, references to large institutional investments, and the expectation of a BTC retest of 100k+ before new highs. Some warn of resistance near 108k-109k, and a few mention recent value drops and lack of volume, but the trend on higher timeframes is slowly creeping up, with bears struggling to push lower. The environment favors cautious long entries, especially with stop-loss management due to volatility and recent choppiness.",
