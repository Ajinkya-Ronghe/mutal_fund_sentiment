    "explanation": "The majority of live comments reflect a bullish to cautious bullish sentiment for BTC. Key opinions include expectations of a breakout if resistance at 108k-109k is overcome, several users highlighting ongoing uptrend signals on higher timeframes (1h, 4h), and mentions of bears losing control. However, there are also doubts, with some users discussing resistance zones, choppy sideways action, and the need for confirmation via daily close. Scalping and short-term entries are common, and a few warn about possible further dips or manipulation.",
