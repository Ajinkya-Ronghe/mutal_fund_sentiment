    "explanation": "Several participants discussed possible bounce levels and upside targets for BTC, such as $106.8k and $108k. There are mentions of buying, long positions, and waiting for a bounce from support. However, some warn to wait for a retracement or more confirmation, and there are references to shorting or caution as well. Overall, sentiment leans slightly bullish for a near-term bounce, but there is notable hesitation and calls for patience.",
