    "explanation": "Sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish with BTC outperforming other assets, strong ETF inflows ($588M), and positive momentum above key resistance levels (107k-109k). Several experienced traders mention holding or entering long positions, and technical signals like RSI bounce and Donchian channel support are noted. Despite some noting overbought conditions and the potential for short-term corrections, the majority view is that dips are for buying, with upside targets even beyond 109k mentioned. The narrative is reinforced by widespread agreement, large participation, and few credible bearish takes. Leverage must be managed prudently, but 20x isolated is considered safe by multiple commenters given current volatility and clear trend.",
