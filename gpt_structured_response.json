    "explanation": "Opinion flow is mixed but with a strong inclination toward bullish action and dip-buying. Many participants reported closing shorts, entering new longs, or preparing to long on key technical levels (USDT.D retest, support holds, 1-min/15-min bullish signals). Multiple mentions of high leverage and confidence in buying dips, as well as references to BTC being 'on sale' under $1M, reinforce the buy bias. Some discuss volatility and near-term downside risk, but the dominant actionable theme is to buy or prepare to buy on technical signals and dips. Calls for holding, never selling, and long-term upside remain strong.",
