    "explanation": "BTC is experiencing high volatility near key resistance levels (107,000â108,000), yet sentiment is predominantly bullish due to strong uptrend confirmations on higher timeframes (4h moneyflow, stochastic RSI, trendline breaks). Multiple users report successful long positions, and technical indicators (4h moneyflow turning green, daily stochastic pushing higher) suggest continuation of the move up. There are some short-term retracement and profit-taking comments, but the majority view is to buy dips or hold longs for further upside. Macro factors such as tech stocks strength and positive news flow (e.g., Fed's Powell allowing banks to conduct crypto activities) further support upward bias. Price targets from participants range from 108,500 to 130,000+, with some aggressive projections to 150,000. Risk remains due to possible liquidity sweeps and stop-loss hunting, but the prevailing view is to stay long with tight risk management.",
