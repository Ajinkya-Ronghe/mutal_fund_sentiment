    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions are bearish or neutral for BTC, with many traders noting sideways price action, bearish flags, trap setups, or suggesting a downtrend. Some mention SL hunting and retail order liquidity grabs, while only a handful expect an upside move or breakout. There are repeated references to 'sideways', 'bearish flag', 'SL hunting', and direct 'sell' calls. Despite a few bullish voices, the market sentiment is overall cautious and leans bearish for the short term.",
