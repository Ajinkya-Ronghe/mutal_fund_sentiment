    "explanation": "BTC remains the primary focus in the chat with active trading discussions, including both buy and sell sides. There is visible volatility and strong community engagement, with several users mentioning active buy trades, holding positions, and looking for long entries. Despite short-term uncertainty and some caution around rapid price movements, the consensus leans toward a bullish bias for scalping and short-term entries. Multiple users express confidence that BTC will move higher, referencing technical levels (107200, 107450) and expecting rebounds from local supports. Occasional mentions of shorting or booking profits reflect healthy skepticism, but the dominant sentiment is optimism for upward moves. The presence of high leverage discussions (20x, 50x, and more) among traders also indicates strong conviction in significant price action.",
