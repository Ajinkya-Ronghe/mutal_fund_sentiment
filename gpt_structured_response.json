    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term calls and mentions of bearish divergence and key price tests, there is strong retail support for buying BTC on dips, holding long positions, and expectations of an upcoming bounce or rally. Many traders discuss taking long entries near key support levels (103k-105k), with several referencing successful scalps and long trades at ~107k. Calls for 'buy the dip', 'BTC will turn around soon', and anticipation of a bullish move after consolidation indicate renewed bullish sentiment. Short-term volatility is acknowledged, but the prevailing view is that BTC remains a buy especially for scalpers and those using 1-minute candlestick signals. Use safe leverage and consider isolated futures trading for risk management.",
