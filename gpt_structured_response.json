    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed with strong opinions both for and against, but recent comments emphasize upcoming pumps, whale accumulation, and a technical retracement after a sharp pullback. Bulls highlight potential for further upside and BTC dominance, while bears warn of liquidity sweeps and possible crashes. The market is consolidating, with many waiting for a breakout. Overall, the bias slightly favors a cautious long with limited leverage.",
