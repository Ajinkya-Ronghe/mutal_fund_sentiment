    "explanation": "Several participants mention breakout, trending up on higher timeframes, and scalping opportunities in BTC. There is discussion about BTC holding support levels (106.5k, 98k), a recent breakout, and long trade setups. Some traders are actively long from around 107,700â98k, and sentiment is positive on further upside if resistance is broken. However, there are mixed short-term views (some mention resistance at 108kâ109k, and potential for a short at those levels), and a recent drop created caution among some. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic with continued volatility expected, but risk of a pullback remains near resistance. Leverage recommendations are low or moderate, with an emphasis on using stop losses and careful risk management.",
