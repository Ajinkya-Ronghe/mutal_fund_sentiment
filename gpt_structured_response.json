    "explanation": "Multiple participants in the live chat discussed bullish momentum, holding long positions, and expecting a pump to higher levels (e.g., 'its soooo bullish', 'pump it', '120k here we go'). Some mentioned technical confirmations (EMA curling up, above cloud), while a few expressed skepticism about the move's validity or noted rejection at resistance (Ichimoku cloud, vwap play). Overall, sentiment leans bullish but with some caution and a need for more confirmation.",
