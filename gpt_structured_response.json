    "explanation": "Despite short-term volatility and mixed retail sentiment, the majority of opinions and influential voices signal confidence in Bitcoin's long-term upward trend. Multiple users discussed holding through retracements, past profitable long positions, and resilience at key support levels. Institutional dominance, strong uptrend in BTC.D (Bitcoin dominance), and several mentions of waiting for bounce or reversal at major support zones point to an overall bullish bias. While there are a few calls for shorting or caution due to market whipsaws and news events, the positive convictions, especially from experienced traders, outweigh the negatives. Many seek re-entry or confirmation to go long, and there is active interest in leveraging up to 20x safely in perpetual futures. The market expects volatility but sees opportunity for further gains after retracements.",
