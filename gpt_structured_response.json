    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate bullish sentiment or favor long positions in BTC. Multiple users mention holding or entering long trades (e.g., 'I see 200btc in long pos', 'that's why just long BTC forever', 'with a TP @109', 'We need to get above $106,500. If it doesnât break above and hold soon down.', 'Broke $106500 nice! Itâs BTC time.'), while some highlight retail shorts getting squeezed and expectation for higher prices. There are some short/sell mentions, but these are fewer and often countered with reasons for bullishness (e.g., retail shorts being wrong, spot buying on dips, or trailing SL on longs). Technical references (RSI, Donchian channel, weekly candle strength, key levels above 106,500) and positive momentum support a buy signal. Leverage should remain conservative but can go up to 20x in isolated perpetuals based on overall confidence.",
