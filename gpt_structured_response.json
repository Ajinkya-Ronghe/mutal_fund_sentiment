    "explanation": "Despite some negative sentiment and volatility, there is strong consensus in the chat for a potential upward move in BTC from current levels. Many users are discussing holding, buying, or looking for new entries. There is mention of support and bounce zones, potential for upside targets (e.g., 108,500), and several are waiting for the right candle or confirmation to go long. The chat also reflects that some are already in long positions or planning to add. While there are comments about manipulation and possible downside, the majority of actionable signals indicate a buy-the-dip or hold bias for BTC. Leverage is often discussed as 20x by users.",
