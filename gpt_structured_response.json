    "explanation": "The majority of opinions mention BTC in bullish contexts, including references to W patterns, bullish candles, and levels like 107600-108500 being targeted for upward movement. Some users confirm buying or holding positions, and there are confirmations of long entries and breakouts above resistance. However, a few users express concerns about potential reversals near resistance, bearish patterns, or the market being choppy/sideways, so overall confidence is medium.",
