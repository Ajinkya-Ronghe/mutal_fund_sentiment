    "explanation": "Despite short-term volatility, the majority of live opinions suggest resilience above key support levels (106k-107k), upcoming bullish targets (103k, 105k, 108.4k, 120k, and even 240k mentioned), and repeated encouragement for long entries. Many traders are reporting current or planned buys, support holding, and bullish divergences on lower timeframes. There are some bearish voices, but they are countered by a larger number of traders highlighting bounces, resistance breaks, and algorithmic 'buy' calls. The overall sentiment leans bullish, especially for quick timeframes, supported by positive references to technical levels and ongoing buying activity. Safe leverage for isolated perpetual futures is suggested at 20x due to the volatility and fluctuating sentiment.",
