    "explanation": "There are mixed opinions, but several users mention potential breakouts, support around 107500â109000, and expectation of upward movement after retest. Some are cautious due to sideways/consolidation, but the overall sentiment leans to a buy on dips or after confirmation. No clear high-confidence bullish consensus, but more positive than negative in the current context.",
