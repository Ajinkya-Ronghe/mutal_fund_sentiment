    "explanation": "Despite visible short-term volatility, mixed opinions, and active shorting among retail traders, there is significant evidence of ongoing accumulation, long interest, and key resistance levels being broken. Several users report profit-taking from longs, anticipation of further upside if weekly closes remain strong, and expectations of a squeeze as shorts pile up. The presence of high leverage, rapid oscillations, and strong opinions about FOMO and buying dips strengthen the bullish case. While some expect corrections or dumps, the overall sentiment, especially among notable accounts and those tracking institutional activity, suggests continued upward momentum with high volatility. This is further reinforced by live trade calls for 'buy BTC' and recurring retail interest in buy-side trades.",
