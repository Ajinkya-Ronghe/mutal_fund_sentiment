    "explanation": "Despite a split in sentiment and some visible short-term bearish calls (e.g., head and shoulders, pullbacks to 104k, and multiple traders shorting), the market has shown resilience at key support levels (notably around 104k-106k). There are repeated mentions of large liquidations below and a consensus that BTC is absorbing selling pressure (e.g., 'all alts dumped, just wall street propping up BTC', 'people selling alts to put on BTC'). Multiple users expect a reversal or bounce ('BTC/USDT Long Boom TP3!', 'reversal incoming', '108500 tak jaega', 'this now go buy', 'big fluctuations, play it nice'), and Marticlues AI signals hit all long targets up to TP3. Consolidation near the lows and lack of major breakdowns, along with algorithmic long signals and a return of bullish momentum in short timeframes, support a new long entry. Positive order flow, support at 104k-106k, and repeated algorithmic long signals justify high confidence for a leveraged long setup.",
