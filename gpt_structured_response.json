    "explanation": "The majority of opinions express concern about BTC's downside risk, with several participants asking whether to sell, reporting selling, or describing heavy selling pressure. Some mention technical signals such as 'bear flag', failed support, and lack of strategic consistency in BTC. A few voices note sideways or choppy price action and warn of possible big fluctuations ahead. There are also opposing opinions suggesting possible buys or that BTC is holding support, but these are fewer and less strongly worded. Thus, the overall sentiment leans slightly bearish, but with medium confidence due to the presence of mixed and neutral inputs.",
