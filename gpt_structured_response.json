Some references are made to key support levels (1072, 1068) and the need for stop losses, with users noting a possible breakdown of the uptrend and tiredness of the 50 EMA holding BTC candles. However, there is also a minority long opinion targeting 108300, but overall, more voices highlight risk or a bearish setup than bullish momentum.",
