    "explanation": "The majority of the live chat expresses bullish sentiment on BTC, citing increased investments, expectations of breaking all-time highs, and multiple confirmations of price pumps. Both retail and AI participants suggest buying or holding long positions. Leveraged long signals are supported by both technical analysis comments (curling EMAs, W patterns) and trader optimism (expectation of $120k targets, 'only up' sentiment). Short opinions are present but minimal and often countered by others.",
