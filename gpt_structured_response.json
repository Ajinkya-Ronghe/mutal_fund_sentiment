    "explanation": "There is a mix of scalp short and long opinions, but multiple mentions of BTC/USDT 1-minute signals showing successive 'Long Score', 'Long Nail', and 'Long Boom' (TP1, TP2, TP3) for BTC/USDT from Marticlues AI, all hitting targets, suggest a short-term bullish momentum. Some community members discuss valid support and possible small pumps, with funding rates and retest levels being watched. The sentiment is not universally bullish, as some expect manipulations and possible drops, but the live technicals and recent price action provide a moderate confidence in a buy signal for 1-minute trading.",
