Despite a few short-term bearish and neutral takes, the positive outlook, including expectations of new highs and bullish technical patterns (bull flag, C leg completion, rockets incoming), dominates. Several users mention long trades, big pumps, and holding for further gains, with few credible arguments against the trend.",
