    "explanation": "The majority of opinions express strong bullish sentiment for BTC, with repeated calls that it will 'moon' and references to big upward targets (e.g., 117k in 87 hours). Several users are excited about upward movement, and there is a mention of BTC moving while other coins are not. Trade calls for WBTC (wrapped BTC) also suggest a strong buy/long direction, with technical targets and indications of 'whale surge.' There are very few, if any, negative or neutral opinions about BTC, further increasing confidence in a long/buy signal.",
