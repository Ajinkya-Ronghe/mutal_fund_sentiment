    "explanation": "BTC is currently showing strong bullish momentum, with multiple users expressing confidence in higher targets (109k, 113k, 115k, and 120k mentioned). There is significant FOMO, and several are reporting breakouts above key resistance levels (106,500 and 108,000). Most short positions are facing stress or liquidation, further fueling upward movement. While some caution about potential dumps or traps, the overwhelming sentiment is bullish, supported by discussions of institutional buying (e.g., Metaplanet, Michael Saylor) and a positive market structure. Scalpers and intraday traders are actively seeking long entries, and the majority opinion expects new highs soon.",
