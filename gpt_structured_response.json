    "explanation": "The majority of opinions reflect bullish momentum for BTC, with many participants expecting price targets like 108k, 109k, and even higher (113k+). There is repeated mention of strong liquidity at higher levels, short squeezes, and renewed buying interest after a perceived bottom. While some short-term traders discuss taking profits or potential pullbacks, the overall sentiment is driven by bullish macro news (e.g., expected US rate cuts, Powell's comments, and positive political sentiment). The 1-minute candlestick signal is supported by ongoing buy entries, calls to hold, and strong upward momentum, further confirmed by a high number of live trade entries and profit bookings. Leverage is set at a safe but aggressive level (20x isolate future perpetual) due to the strong confidence and liquidity.",
