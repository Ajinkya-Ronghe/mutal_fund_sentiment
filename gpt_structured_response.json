    "explanation": "The sentiment for BTC is overwhelmingly bullish across the live chat. Multiple users discuss BTC breaking through key resistance levels (108k, 109k), with comments on strong uptrend, breakouts, and momentum. There are repeated mentions of buying, holding, and targets above 108k and 109k. Pullbacks are viewed as buying opportunities and the overall mood is FOMO and euphoria. While a few users mention caution or potential short-term retracement, the vast majority favor continuation of the uptrend, supported by candlestick and trend signals. Leverage questions are frequent, with consensus around high leverage for experienced traders, and an explicit recommendation of 20x in the chat.",
