    "explanation": "Multiple participants mention BTC's resilience and bullish structure despite hashrate drops and sideways movement, with strong sentiment for holding or entering long positions. There is consensus around critical resistance breakouts (107200+), and an expectation of further price explosions once shorts are squeezed. Some caution about short-term retraces and supply zones, but the overall momentum, positive candlestick signals (WBTC/USDT long hitting all targets), and community expectation for 109k-120k targets support a high-confidence buy. Leverage comments and perpetuals indicate 20x as a common safe option among scalpers and swing traders.",
