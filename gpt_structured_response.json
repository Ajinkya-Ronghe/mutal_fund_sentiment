    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is divided but slightly tilts bearish. Multiple users mention ongoing or recent sell/short positions, targets below current prices (e.g., 106100, 103000, 101000), and caution about aggressive dumps, bear flags, and support breaks. Some bullish comments exist (breakout, buy, uptrend, pump soon, consolidation), but they are contradicted by more frequent or urgent short/exit/bearish warnings. Several participants are waiting for confirmation after daily or 4hr closes and do not recommend immediate long entries. The mixed but more vocal bearishness and real-time references to price action (big red candles, support break, lower highs, double tops) support a short-term 'Sell' signal, with medium confidence due to the presence of opposing bullish opinions.",
