    "explanation": "There is a strong presence of both bullish and bearish opinions, but the bullish sentiment slightly outweighs the bearish. Many users are discussing buying on dips, taking long entries, and expecting higher targets (108000, 108500, 110000). Several mention strong buying interest, potential for a big green candle, or that BTC will climb fast from support. However, there are also notable warnings about possible dumps, resistance at key levels, and suggestions to wait for retests. This mixed but positive-leaning sentiment, especially with references to market structure and liquidity sweeps, supports a cautious buy with moderate confidence.",
