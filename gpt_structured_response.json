    "explanation": "The majority of opinions express concern over a potential rejection and significant dump for BTC, with repeated references to lower price targets (e.g., 'see you at 90k', 'maaassive dump incoming', 'rejected', 'can't stay 108 for a week'). Although there are a few bullish outliers (e.g., 'hoping BTC go to 108k', 'no leverage long since 73k'), the prevailing sentiment is short-term bearish. Some traders are explicitly calling for short positions or expecting downside volatility.",
