    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment, expectations of a breakout continuation, and targets above current levels such as $108k, $120k-$130k. Multiple participants reference confirmed bull flag breakouts and sustained positive momentum. While there are mentions of fakeouts and some cautious outlooks, the prevailing sentiment, price targets, and FOMO suggest a high-confidence buy signal. However, there is some mention of large sell orders (e.g., 500btc at 108k) which warrants caution at resistance, but does not override the overall bullish consensus.",
