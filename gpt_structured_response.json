    "explanation": "The opinions are mixed but skew bearish in the short term. Multiple users mention selling at current or near-current levels (108000-108300), warn of strong resistance, and suggest preparing for shorts. There is mention of a recent 7-day high and some bullish sentiment about institutional interest and price targets above 109k, but more direct calls to sell or short in the immediate range. Representative opinions include: 'Sell at the top boys', 'TioRyo: 108000- SELL', 'oscartg638: get your shorts ready', 'Alhamaf: Sell', and 'Tpol: Huge short positions @108.7'. However, some users still express medium- to longer-term bullishness (e.g., corporations buying, ultra rich, price targets of 111-114k), so the confidence is rated as medium rather than high.",
