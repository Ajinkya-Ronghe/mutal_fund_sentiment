    "explanation": "The majority of BTC-related opinions express uncertainty and concern about support levels being tested, with several users noting bearish price action, failed bull flags, and expectations of a further downward move before a possible bounce. While some mention a potential short-term pop or range-trading, the consensus is that BTC is at risk of losing key support and could see a significant drop if not reclaimed quickly. There is no strong bullish conviction in the current sentiment.",
