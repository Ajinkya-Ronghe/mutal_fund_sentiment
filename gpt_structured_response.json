Several users suggest consolidating, holding support, or expecting a bounce and V-shape recovery. Despite some warnings of fakeouts or short-term drops, there is a notable presence of traders discussing long trades, targets above current prices, and an overall expectation of a move upwards or recovery. The environment is choppy, but positive momentum is favored as per the 1-minute candlestick and general sentiment.",
