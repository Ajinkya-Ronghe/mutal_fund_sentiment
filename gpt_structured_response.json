    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is leaning bearish for BTC. Multiple users mentioned a 'crash', 'dump', 'downtrend', and key levels such as $106,500 and $104,400 as potential support levels. Some participants noted highly manipulated price action and a lack of bullish momentum, with others suggesting to close long positions or expecting further downside. However, there are a few neutral and slightly bullish remarks about potential rebounds and key trendline holds, so the confidence is medium rather than high.",
