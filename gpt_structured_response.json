    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish across multiple chat participants, with many expressing regret over missed longs, desires for new all-time highs, and a focus on upward momentum. Despite some holding short positions or waiting for news, the majority expects further price increases, referencing higher targets (e.g., 108,500, 112,000, and 150,000). Several users mention strong liquidity to the upside and the expectation of a continued bull run. Some volatility and mixed short scalps exist, but they are outnumbered by long/bullish opinions. The presence of FOMO and retail buying further supports a continued upward move. Powell's speech and broader market conditions are being closely watched, but there is no major negative fundamental catalyst present in the opinions.",
