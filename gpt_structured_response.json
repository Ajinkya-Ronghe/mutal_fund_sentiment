    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bullish in the short term. Multiple participants mention BTC breaking key levels (like $106.5k), holding local supports, and expecting an upside breakout as seen in previous weeks. Some express uncertainty, awaiting confirmation on daily close, while others highlight ongoing consolidation and the need for patience. Negative comments (e.g., expecting a dip or chop) are present but often countered by bullish outlooks and references to liquidity sweeps trapping sellers. No strong signals for aggressive leverage, but isolated, moderate leverage is reasonable due to ongoing volatility.",
