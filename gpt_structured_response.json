    "explanation": "BTC continues to demonstrate strong bullish sentiment despite minor volatility and mixed retail noise. Many users report long-term holding success and multiple anecdotes reference significant profits, mortgage payoffs, and major life changes attributed to BTC gains. Multiple chat messages express the belief that BTC remains the leading opportunity even if not as 'cheap' as before, with some calling it 'the cheapest it has ever been' in macro terms. Technical discussion highlights higher highs being made, with advice to buy on breakouts and positive bias towards upside moves. A few mentions of short-term dips or resistance, but these are vastly outnumbered by calls to 'buy', 'hold', and 'HODL'. Several explicitly ask if now is a good entry, while others answer affirmatively and reference current or recent buys. There is substantial positive momentum and social sentiment, with only minor neutral/negative comments and no major bearish consensus. Recommended leverage remains 20x for isolated futures/perpetuals as per current risk appetite and prevailing bullish bias.",
