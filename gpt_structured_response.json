    "explanation": "Numerous participants are bullish on BTC, with many discussing potential for explosive upward moves, bullish consolidations, and expectations of reaching new highs such as 109k-111k and even 120k. There is acknowledgment of recent hashrate drops and possible volatility, but the majority sentiment remains optimistic, with several urging entries or re-entries for long-term gains. Key resistance and support levels are debated, but overall, the prevailing view is to maintain or add to long positions, especially on healthy pullbacks. Some short-term volatility and pullbacks are expected, but the broad consensus is for continued upside.",
