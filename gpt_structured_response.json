    "explanation": "Sentiment is highly mixed but with a slight positive tilt due to multiple bullish comments, expectations of new all-time highs, and several mentions of buying or holding BTC for the long term. There is strong resistance noted around 108000-110000, and several traders expect volatility, with calls for both short and long entries. However, the presence of heavy sell walls, short-term bearish signals (bear flag, heavy resistance, liquidity zones), and several traders taking profits or cautioning about a reversal keep confidence at medium.",
