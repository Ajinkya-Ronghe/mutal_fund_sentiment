    "explanation": "The majority of chat sentiment is bullish for BTC, with repeated mentions of upward price targets (e.g., 108500, 109521, 112k, 118251.8), FOMO (fear of missing out) on buying, and calls for 'pump' or continuation rallies. Some are discussing holding longs, waiting for breakout confirmations, or regretting selling too early. There is also mention of institutional accumulation zones (around 70k), and references to macro factors (Powell speech, S&P at ATH, liquidity) supporting bullish bias. Negative or short opinions exist but are outnumbered by bullish or neutral-to-bullish entries. 1-minute and higher timeframe signals are discussed, with some seeing breakouts and others waiting for dips to buy. The overall community tone is strongly risk-on with high appetite for leverage trading.",
