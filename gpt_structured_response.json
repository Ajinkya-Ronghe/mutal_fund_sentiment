    "explanation": "The majority of BTC-related opinions indicate anticipation of a strong upward move (pump), with some discussing high price targets (e.g., 120k, 150k), FOMO, and an ongoing trend. However, there are also a few warnings about the regional high, potential corrections, and not buying at the top, which tempers overall confidence. The 1-minute sentiment is skewed bullish due to repeated calls for pumps, 'rocket ship', and 'long' entries, though some participants are waiting for structure confirmation or calling for possible corrections. Net sentiment is moderately positive.",
