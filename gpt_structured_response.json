    "explanation": "Most opinions skew bullish, referencing high long-term price targets (1 million in 5 years, forever up, bears getting rekt), immediate buy calls, and bullish sentiment. However, there are a few cautionary and bearish voices noting possible fake breakouts, bull traps, and lower lows, and some mention of sideways movement, which lowers overall confidence. No clear short-term candlestick reversal is indicated in aggregate.",
