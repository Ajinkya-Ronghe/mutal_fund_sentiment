    "explanation": "BTC broke major resistance at 108k and continued to surge, with multiple confirmations of uptrend momentum, strong bullish sentiment, and ongoing buy signals from both retail and institutional traders. Despite some short-term concerns and short attempts, the majority of opinions point to persistent buying pressure, FOMO, and higher targets being hit rapidly. Traders are discussing retracement buys, new ATH celebrations, and the lack of significant pullbacks, all indicating strong bullish bias. Market discussions about safe leverage also suggest continued confidence in upward moves.",
