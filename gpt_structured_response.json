    "explanation": "Across a very large and diverse set of live chat opinions, BTC sentiment is mixed but tilting bullish. Many participants mention holding longs despite recent drops, referencing BTC dominance and technical retracements as bullish signals. Numerous messages mention holding, waiting for breakouts or new all-time highs, and seeing liquidity above. Some call for 110k-115k+ targets, and multiple users booked profits on long entries from lower levels. Short-term volatility and stop-loss hits are mentioned, but more community members are suggesting long entries, holding, and targeting higher levels than those actively shorting. Several traders explicitly ask about or confirm new long entries. The candlestick signal on the 1-minute chart is referenced as long by multiple users. Risk appetite is high, and leverage is discussed, with 20x considered safe for isolated perpetuals. Representative opinions show strong bullish conviction, though there are still a notable number of short/trap cautions and neutral queries about direction.",
