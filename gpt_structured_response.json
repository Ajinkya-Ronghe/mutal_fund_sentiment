    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed, but several comments highlight failed attempts to break all-time highs, frequent traps, and a need for downside to recharge for larger upside. Many traders are expressing frustration with choppy, sideways action and traps, with suggestions that a pullback or further drop to 104k-105k is likely before any bullish move. There is also a sentiment that manipulation and market-making are more likely to induce a downside move in the near term.",
