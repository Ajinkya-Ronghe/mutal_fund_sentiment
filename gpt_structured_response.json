    "explanation": "The majority of technical opinions on BTC suggest caution for immediate trades, as several users note price rejection at key levels on short timeframes (1min, 5min), warn of a potential trap for longs, and reference a recent double top and rejection at the high average weekly range. There is consensus that BTC has moved up significantly in recent days and a retracement is likely before another long setup is safe. Few overtly bullish signals; overall the tone is cautious to bearish on the very short term.",
