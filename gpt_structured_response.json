    "explanation": "The majority of actionable BTC-related opinions indicate a bearish short-term sentiment, with mentions of 'the crash', 'massacre soon', 'waterfall', 'big short', and users discussing key support levels breaking. There are explicit calls to 'short BTC', comments on downtrends starting, and warnings about potential price drops to $104k-$105k. Some contrarian or neutral takes exist (e.g., 'bull flag' and 'rockets incoming'), but the prevailing mood is cautionary, especially for high leverage or scalp longs. Multiple participants are closing longs or expecting further downside, and candlestick signals point to red candles and breaking support levels.",
