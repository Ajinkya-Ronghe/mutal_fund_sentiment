    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "The sentiment for BTC is predominantly bullish based on a large number of comments indicating upward movement, long entries, and technical analysis pointing to bullish indicators (trend lines upward, bullish stochastic, strong correlation with tech stocks rally). Several users mention specific entry levels for longs, targets above current prices (e.g., 108500, 110k, and even 150k being discussed), and positive reactions to recent price action. Although there are a few short-term bearish comments and warnings about possible dips or bull traps, these are outnumbered by positive or neutral-to-positive opinions. Many traders are holding longs or looking for new long entries, and bullish technical signals (trend line support, stochastics, higher highs) are cited repeatedly. There is also discussion about managing profits and holding current long positions rather than exiting.",
