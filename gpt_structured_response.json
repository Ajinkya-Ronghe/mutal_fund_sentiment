    "explanation": "Despite high volatility and mixed short-term sentiment, the overall consensus is that BTC is seeing strong buy pressure after a recent dip, with many participants actively entering long positions or planning to buy on pullbacks. Multiple users mentioned institutional interest, technical indicators signaling bullishness (e.g., bullish 1-min, 15-min and 1hr RSI, and support zones holding), and expectation of a bounce from current levels. There are some concerns about a possible further dip to 104-106k, but this is largely viewed as a buying opportunity rather than a sustained downtrend. Many traders recommend holding or accumulating, with strong conviction in eventual upward movement and favorable macro news (e.g., possible Fed rate cuts).",
