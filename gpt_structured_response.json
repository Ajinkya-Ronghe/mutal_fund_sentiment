    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bearish in the short term. There are several mentions of strong resistance at levels like 107.8k and 108k, with warnings that a break above could trigger a run higher, but sellers are described as being in control. Multiple participants expect a drop to 105k or lower, referencing absorption of market buys by limit sellers and noting that the market is confused and volatile. Some mention waiting for support/resistance breaks before entering trades, and there are warnings to use tight stop losses due to volatility. The presence of both longing and shorting opinions, but with more visible immediate-term caution and bearish positioning, suggests a short bias for the next 1-minute candle.",
