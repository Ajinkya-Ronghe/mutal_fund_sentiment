    "explanation": "The majority of real-time comments reflect bearish sentiment or uncertainty. There are mentions of red candles, 'massacre', 'waterfall', and 'dump incoming', along with users discussing covering longs and suggesting short positions around specific levels. Some positive or neutral opinions (e.g., 'hit the bottom', 'good buy') exist, but the overall tone is biased towards a short-term sell/short, particularly for scalpers in the 1-minute timeframe. The market is described as choppy with low volume and flat candles, increasing risk.",
