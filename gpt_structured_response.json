    "explanation": "Many participants are noting BTC is bouncing from daily open, and some are calling for a pump after a drop to support near 105k-107k, but there is significant uncertainty and calls for both upside and downside moves. There is a positive sentiment about holding and not selling BTC. Some mention short-term bearish fractals, but the majority lean toward a long after a potential dip. Leverage suggestions remain moderate, favoring caution.",
