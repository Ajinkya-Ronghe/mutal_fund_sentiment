    "explanation": "The sentiment around BTC in the provided live chat is predominantly bullish, with many participants discussing long entries, holding positions, and upcoming price targets well above current levels (e.g., 98k, 106k, 109k, 600k, 100k, 108500). There is repeated mention of trendline breaks to the upside, continuous green candles on higher timeframes (like 4hr), and multiple confirmations of 'long' signals even after minor dumps. While some users express caution or mention short setups, the overwhelming majority are discussing buying, holding, or imminent upward moves. The chat also includes references to major news (e.g., GameStop buying Bitcoin as a reserve asset), further boosting bullish sentiment. Leverage discussions typically revolve around moderate to high leverage, with many users asking about safe leverage, and 20x is a commonly referenced safe area for experienced traders.",
