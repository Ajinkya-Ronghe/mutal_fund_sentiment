    "explanation": "The majority of relevant opinions suggest caution: BTC is currently facing rejection at key levels (trendline, double top on 1h, failed 1m/5m retest), with warnings about a possible trap for longs and suggestions to wait for a retracement or short. However, there is some disagreement, as a few viewers note the uptrend is still intact and some are bullish about long-term targets. The overall short-term sentiment leans bearish or neutral, with a focus on waiting for better entry or a retracement rather than immediate buying.",
