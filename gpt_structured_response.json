    "explanation": "BTC shows strong dominance and sustained bullish sentiment across multiple opinions. There is significant mention of high BTC dominance, ETF inflows, and resilience despite resistance and lack of retracement. Many participants are discussing holding or longing BTC, with some suggesting new highs are likely, and several referencing bullish news such as ETF inflows and geopolitical relief (Iran-Israel ceasefire). Even amid sideway movement or minor corrections, the overall consensus is upward momentum, with some traders seeking to buy or hold rather than exit. Negative opinions (calls for short or expecting a drop) are present but are outnumbered by long/hold recommendations and positive momentum signals.",
