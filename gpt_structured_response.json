    "explanation": "BTC sentiment in the live chat is predominantly bullish, with many users expecting pumps, new all-time highs (ATH), and price targets above current levels (e.g., 108,500, 109,000, 112,000, even 120,000). Scalpers and swing traders are sharing successful long trades. Some highlight breakout confirmation, 1-minute and 5-minute bullish signals, and price action above key levels (e.g., breaking and holding above 106,500). There are some shorts and warnings of corrections, but the majority sees upward momentum, especially with external catalysts like Powell's testimony and macro news. High leverage is discussed as safe with proper risk management. Representative candlestick signals (long) from Marticlues AI and user confirmation further strengthen the bullish bias.",
