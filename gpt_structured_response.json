    "explanation": "The majority of live opinions reflect bullish sentiment or expectations for further upside in BTC. Several traders mention holding BTC, buying on dips, and anticipating higher price targets (e.g., 109K, ATH in 12 days). Technical discussions reference bullish patterns such as flag and pole, support at local Fibonacci levels, and expectations of upside from current retracements. Isolated negative and neutral opinions (calls for a drop or sideways) were noted, but positive outlooks dominate, especially regarding current and near-term price action. Long trades and holding strategies are repeatedly suggested, and there is strong community interest in BTC over altcoins at the moment.",
