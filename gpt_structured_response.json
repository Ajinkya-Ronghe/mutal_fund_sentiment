    "explanation": "Despite some short-term bearish calls and volatility, the overall sentiment from multiple users highlights strong bullish momentum, with several traders targeting new highs. Many mention key resistance levels being approached or broken, and there are discussions of buying on dips, scalping upside, and expectations of BTC reaching 108,500 or even all-time highs. Some concerns about short-term dumps and resistance exist, but the positive count is significantly higher, and representative opinions support a continued bullish bias. Technical mentions of strong support at the 50-day EMA and a 'cup and handle' pattern, along with news-driven bullishness (Powell speech, Trump effect), further support a high-confidence buy. Leverage should be managed prudently due to volatility.",
