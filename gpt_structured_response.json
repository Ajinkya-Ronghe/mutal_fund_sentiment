    "explanation": "Opinions are highly mixed but tilt slightly bullish. Several users mention new highs, pumps, and buy suggestions, while others warn of strong resistance, market absorption, and possible reversals. There is notable discussion of large walls and both bullish and bearish pressure, reflecting a volatile and indecisive short-term sentiment. The 1-minute candlestick signal cannot be strongly determined as 'long' or 'short' due to this split; however, the prevailing mood from key voices is to watch for upward moves and not miss out on potential rallies.",
