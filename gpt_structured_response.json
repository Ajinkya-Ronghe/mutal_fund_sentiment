    "explanation": "Despite strong mixed discussion, the majority of sentiment for BTC is bullish, with multiple users referencing price targets above 108k, 109k, and even 119k. Several opinions highlight booking profit at certain levels but planning to re-enter on pullbacks, suggesting strong bullish conviction. Multiple users discussed holding, momentum, and potential for all-time highs. There is some short-term caution around news and volatility, but the overall consensus leans towards a continued uptrend, especially on 1-minute momentum and scalping signals. Negative sentiment (calls for dump or short) is present but is outnumbered by the positive and neutral-to-bullish swing trading and holding opinions. The bulk of actionable talk is about longing on dips, holding, or expecting further upside. A safe leverage up to 20x is suggested based on high conviction and market structure.",
