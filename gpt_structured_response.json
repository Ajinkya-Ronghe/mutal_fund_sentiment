    "explanation": "Despite some bearish opinions and short-term volatility, the majority of comments suggest bullish momentum for BTC. There are repeated mentions of support holding, expectation of upward movement, bullish news, and confirmation from multiple technical patterns (e.g., 9 green H4 candles, breakout signals, higher highs). Several users are already in long positions, and Marticlues AI provides a strong 'Long' signal with specific entry and targets. Discussion of Powell's remarks as bullish for institutional inflows adds to the positive sentiment. Negative opinions exist, but the overall sentiment is skewed towards a continued uptrend, especially for scalping and short-term trades. Leverage discussions indicate that 20x isolated future perpetual is within common, safe usage for experienced traders.",
