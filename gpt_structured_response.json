    "explanation": "Despite significant volatility and some bearish sentiment, the overall consensus among traders is preparing for a bounce and a potential rally. Multiple users discuss holding or entering long positions, expecting a turnaround, and reference algorithmic buy signals and price targets up to 108k and 108500. There is also discussion of strong support zones, scalping opportunities, and requests for long entries. Short-term selling is present, but the majority of actionable advice is to look for buying opportunities on dips, evidenced by callouts for 'buy the dip', 'pump in next 4 hrs', and 'BTC 108500 tak jaega'. High engagement with leverage and isolated future perpetual setups suggests confidence in upward movement after the recent drop.",
