    "explanation": "BTC dominance remains strong, multiple users report bullishness tied to dominance and retracement levels, and several comments indicate that BTC is still perceived as cheap compared to its future potential. There is clear sentiment that buying now is favorable, especially with mentions of ongoing or triggered buy entries, positive momentum, and market cap growth potential. Some users identify a bullish reversal after retail capitulation, and several technical traders reference breakouts, retests, and holding for higher targets. While a few users discuss possible short-term volatility or urge caution on specific entries, the overwhelming majority of representative opinions are bullish and urge buying or holding long positions.",
