    "explanation": "Despite recent concerns about the network hashrate drop and potential vulnerability, the overall market sentiment for BTC remains bullish. Many opinions highlight an ongoing slow climb, short squeezes, and the potential for explosive upside moves if resistance levels are broken. Several participants noted significant support around $104k and $106.5k, with targets as high as $109k, $111k, or even $112k. The presence of news, especially from the Federal Reserve and market events, is generating volatility but is not shaking the underlying bullish structure. Multiple requests for re-entry into BTC trades and confirmations to hold or long BTC reinforce the positive outlook. Technical analysis references, such as breakout levels, compression, and short liquidation, suggest a high-probability long setup. A safe leverage up to 20x is suggested for isolated perpetual futures, given volatility but strong support.",
