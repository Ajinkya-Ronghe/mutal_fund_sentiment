    "explanation": "Mixed opinions with a slight bearish tilt. While some expect a new all-time high (105k-108k), several technical analysts point to recent rejections at trendlines, a double top on higher time frames, and warnings about potential bull traps. Many recommend waiting for a retracement before considering longs, with immediate short-term signals (1-min/15-min) showing weakness or rejection. The overall consensus is cautious, suggesting a likely short-term pullback.",
