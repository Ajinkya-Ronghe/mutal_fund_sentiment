    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat is mixed, but there is a notable tilt towards caution and short-term bearishness for BTC based on frequent mentions of resistance, liquidity hunting, order block breakdowns, and potential for a market reversal or drop below current levels. Several participants discuss sell entries, risk of further downside, and strong resistance walls above. However, there are also bullish opinions and targets for higher prices, creating a neutral to slightly bearish short-term outlook. The confidence is medium due to this split, but the immediate candlestick and order flow signals suggest caution or short bias.",
