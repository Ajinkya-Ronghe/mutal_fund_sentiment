    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term opinions and ongoing volatility due to global events, BTC remains the dominant asset attracting capital flow from alts, with visible support around 104k and bullish potential towards 108500 and 110k. Multiple users highlight that alts are being sold for BTC, and there are consistent requests for BTC setup and buy/sell signals with trailing targets. The overall sentiment from the community indicates buying on dips, waiting for volatility to settle for entries, and preference for BTC over alts as a safer play. Whale activity and market structure (consolidation, liquidity sweep, and possible reversal) further support bullish potential. There is strong representation for both shorting and longing, but the balance of opinions and flow of capital suggest a safer, high-confidence long approach with isolated, managed leverage.",
