    "explanation": "Several participants indicate major support and long opportunities around 101,600â107,750, with some expecting a bounce if daily closes hold above 107k. Others mention long-term buy-on-dip strategy, and some anticipate price targets up to 111,400â114,000. Sentiment is not fully unanimousâthere are notable warnings about manipulation and risk at 100k, and some short-term traders are taking short positions or expecting sideways/downward moves. However, the positive long/accumulation opinions and observed support zones outweigh immediate bearish calls.",
