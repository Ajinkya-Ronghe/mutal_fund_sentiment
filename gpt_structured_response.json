    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is overall bullish with strong technical signals. Many participants cite current price action above key levels (e.g., $106,500, $107,200, $108,500) as bullish. Positive momentum is supported by references to the 4h moneyflow crossing green, stochastics entering bullish zones, and correlation with strong tech stock pre-market performance. Several users mention targets above $108k and even $110k, $114k, $120k, and higher. There are short-term caution notes about resistance and liquidity sweeps, but the consensus is that dips are buyable and the trend remains up. No major negative opinions or bear cases dominate. Multiple mentions of 'holding', 'milly runner', 'strong floor', and 'big play' reinforce the positive outlook.",
