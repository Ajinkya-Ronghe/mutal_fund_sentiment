There are also references to increased liquidations, China miners selling, and the DXY (US Dollar Index) pumpingâtypically bearish for BTC. Some users hope for a bounce at lower levels, but most short-term signals are negative or neutral, with warnings to set stop-losses and expect possible further downside.",
