    "explanation": "Despite several mentions of recent volatility, liquidations, and conflicting short-term opinions, the overall sentiment reflects strong interest in buying dips, holding longs, and waiting for a bounce. Multiple users asked for BTC trade direction, entry confirmation, and stop-loss strategies, with many expressing confidence in profitable trading and recovery after losses. Some voices warned of downside, but these were met with calls for patience, buying opportunities, and confidence in upcoming rallies. Educational comments further encouraged leveraging candlestick psychology and risk management for safe trading. No clear majority for sustained bearishness; instead, a consensus emerges around buying or holding BTC with a focus on risk controls.",
