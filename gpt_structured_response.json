    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is strongly bullish with multiple mentions of long entries, expectations of higher targets (108,500â121,000), and confidence in upward moves. Despite some traders mentioning possible retracements to 104k or minor resistance zones, the majority favor upward continuation. Several users also explicitly discuss entering or holding longs, and there is talk of strong liquidity and breaking resistance levels. Bearish views are in the minority and are more focused on short-term corrections rather than trend reversals.",
