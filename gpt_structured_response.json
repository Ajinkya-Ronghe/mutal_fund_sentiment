    "explanation": "Despite some bearish calls and volatility, the majority of discussions emphasize BTC's resilience, high hashrate, and strong upward momentum. Many expect new all-time highs, bullish breakouts, and further pumps, especially with macro factors (e.g., global conflict, institutional sentiment) providing support. Calls for short-term dips are often followed by buy-the-dip or retracement-buy strategies. There is significant bullish sentiment around breaking resistance levels (107k-111k), and several community leaders and experienced traders highlight strong volume and game theory supporting BTC's continued strength. The balance of opinions supports a confident long bias with 20x safe leverage for isolated perpetual futures trades.",
