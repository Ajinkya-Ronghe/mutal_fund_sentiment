    "explanation": "The majority of representative opinions reflect bullish sentiment or buying pressure for BTC. Several users mention holding long positions from lower levels (e.g., 100k), expecting further upside, and trailing stop losses. Technical discussions reference order blocks, RSI bounces, and key levels to watch for bullish continuation. While some users discuss shorting or expecting corrections, the prevailing commentary focuses on long setups and expectations for new highs. There is also active discussion about managing risk, trailing stops, and targeting higher prices (109k, 1 million as a long-term vision). The presence of retail shorts and references to potential short squeezes further reinforce the bullish thesis. Overall, the positive count and forward-looking optimism outweigh the more cautious or bearish takes.",
