    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed but skewed slightly bearish: several users mention shorting, trendline breaks, and manipulation, while some mention holding or the price being stable. The 1-minute signal leans 'short' due to mentions of resistance, manipulation, trendline breaks, and multiple users targeting lower levels (e.g., 106k-109k). However, there is not overwhelming bearish conviction, so confidence is medium.",
