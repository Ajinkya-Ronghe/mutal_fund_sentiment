    "explanation": "The opinions about BTC are mixed, with multiple participants expecting a rejection at current price levels and forecasting significant corrections to lower levels like 103k and 90k. Some anticipate a 'massive dump' and express skepticism about BTC holding above 108k for a sustained period. There are a few bullish comments targeting 120k, but the negative and neutral voices are more prevalent in this sample, suggesting caution. No clear, strong momentum for an immediate long position is evident on the 1-minute timeframe.",
