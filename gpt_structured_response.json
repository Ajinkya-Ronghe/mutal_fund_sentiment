    "explanation": "The majority of the opinions specific to BTC reflect a strong bearish sentiment, with multiple users calling for shorts and discussing lower price forecasts (e.g., 97k, 104k, 107.2k) and a focus on selling. One user mentions a stop loss at 108,500 and a potential move to 109k, but the overall mood is dominated by shorting and expectations of further downside. No strong arguments for buying or holding are present.",
