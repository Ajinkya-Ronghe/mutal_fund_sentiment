RaberTrades repeatedly indicated positive outlook, mentioning miners, treasuries, and a potential launch towards all-time highs. The technical discussion from Y00LKA suggests caution but still proposes setups with both long and short entries and emphasizes risk management, which does not contradict the overall bullish consensus.",
