    "explanation": "Despite a mix of bearish and sideways short-term opinions, the overall sentiment is shifting positive for BTC. Multiple users reference BTC being propped up even as alts dump, and there is discussion of large moves and uptrend continuation (e.g., 'Parabolic: Weâre definitely in an uptrend', 'Unlimited Printsð¤: Itâs buy soon will fly', 'Manggala Yatra: this now go buy'). There is clear interest in entering or holding BTC positions, and many are awaiting or actively trading for a move higher, citing technical support, uptrends, and healthy demand zones. Negative comments are balanced by technical optimism and calls for buys at key support levels. The presence of high-volume shakeouts and wicks also points to institutional accumulation. Most short-term volatility is seen as an opportunity for disciplined entries rather than a reason to panic.",
