    "explanation": "Despite a mix of short-term negative and sideways opinions, the overall sentiment for BTC remains bullish due to heavy institutional support, observed buy signals from multiple participants, and increased liquidity from altcoin rotations into BTC. There is a strong consensus on BTC being the safer trade compared to alts in the current market, with several traders noting imminent or ongoing accumulation and potential for a major move up. While there are mentions of short-term pullbacks and some local shorts, most experienced traders are waiting for dips to buy, and others recommend using USDT dominance and technical patterns for scalping. The consensus is that BTC will see significant fluctuations in the coming weeks but is positioned as the preferred crypto for safe leverage and long trades, especially as alts are being sold off to rotate into BTC.",
