    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment for BTC, with several mentions of breaking new highs, high volume, and bearish traders being 'wiped out.' Comments like 'NEW HIGHER HIGH YEA', 'too much volume we pamping', and 'bears are fucked' suggest a strong upward momentum. There are also references to FOMO and BTC dominance dropping (alt season), but the overall crowd sentiment is highly positive for BTC price action.",
