    "explanation": "Across hundreds of live chat opinions, BTC sentiment leans bullish in the short term. Multiple users report entering long positions at levels near 107,500â108,000, and there's frequent discussion of upside targets (e.g., 108,500, 111,900, 123,000). Some warn of seller traps and liquidity grabs, but these are generally met with buy-the-dip or hold recommendations. There's broad acknowledgment of volatility and risk, but also repeated calls for new bullish entries, requests for BTC buy signals, and confirmations of profit-taking from recent longs. Market participants are watching key technical indicators like EMA crossovers and order blocks, but the prevailing crowd sentiment is to buy or hold BTC for the next move up. Leverage discussions suggest 20x is considered a 'safe' upper limit for isolated perpetuals due to volatility.",
