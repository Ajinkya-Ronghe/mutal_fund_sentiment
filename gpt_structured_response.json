    "explanation": "Several opinions suggest caution and possible short-term downside: users mention fake moves, expectations of a dump, and a need for price to go lower before a breakout. Some suggest setting up short bots and being cautious with leverage. However, there is also optimism for higher targets (115K, 109K, 110-112Kâall-time highs), so the bearish signal is only medium confidence and likely short-term.",
