    "explanation": "BTC remains the primary focus of the market, with significant interest in both short-term trading and long-term entries. Multiple comments point to buying opportunities near major liquidity zones (107k-109k), with retail and influencers discussing potential bounce areas and target zones (e.g., 104k, 105200, 106500, 107000, 109k, 110k, 111k). Despite some bearish short-term sentiment, the overall bias is bullish, with strong support seen at lower levels and recurring positive reports of profit booking and successful trades. There is high engagement from both technical and retail participants, with a consensus that BTC is in a zone where buying is favorable, particularly after recent corrections and liquidity sweeps.",
