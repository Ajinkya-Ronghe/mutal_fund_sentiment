    "explanation": "There are mixed opinions but several comments suggest strong supports being formed (107500, 106500), bullish signals on higher timeframes, and potential for government accumulation. Short-term signals suggest buying if bullish candles close above key liquidity points, while others mention uptrend absorption and daily support holding. However, some warn of low volume and possible manipulations. The overall consensus leans bullish, but with some caution due to volatility and lack of unanimous sentiment.",
