    "explanation": "Multiple opinions indicate bearish momentum or caution for BTC: several users mention shorting, targets to the downside (e.g., 106000, 103000), and references to support breaks and bearish patterns (double top, bear flag, supply zone). Some bullish or mixed signals exist (breakout and uptrend claims, some asking about buying), but the majority sentiment leans bearish in the short term, with calls for booking profits, waiting for average retests, and references to slow/choppy market. The 1-minute candlestick signal aligns with the prevailing short-term sentiment.",
