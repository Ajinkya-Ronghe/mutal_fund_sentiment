    "explanation": "The overall sentiment for BTC in the live chat is cautious-to-bearish. Multiple users reference recent price drops, concerns about miner selling, and liquidation risks. While a few participants hope for a bounce at lower levels, the majority of actionable opinions discuss downside targets, support levels, and suggest taking short positions or setting stop-losses. There is also mention of DXY pumping, typically bearish for BTC. No clear bullish catalyst or consensus for a long. The environment is uncertain, but the lean is toward playing downside with protective risk management.",
