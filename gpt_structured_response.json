    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is highly mixed, with a slight leaning toward caution and short setups in the immediate term. Multiple participants mention strong resistance at 107.8k-108k and warn about potential traps and sell pressure, with some suggesting 104k or 105k as possible target zones. Others highlight market confusion, liquidation risks, and caution against overleveraging. A few bullish voices exist, but most are wary or expect a pullback before any new upside. The overall tone for the next candles is defensive, expecting sell-offs at key resistance and a possible short-term drop.",
