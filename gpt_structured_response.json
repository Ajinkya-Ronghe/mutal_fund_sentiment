    "explanation": "A significant number of opinions indicate bearish sentiment, with mentions of bearish flags, selling pressure, and expectations of further downside. There are also repeated references to sideways or choppy price action, suggesting indecision or lack of strong bullish momentum. While a few users mention upside potential or possible breakouts, the prevailing mood is cautious, with many expressing frustration over losses, sideways movement, and SL (stop-loss) hunting. Some technical references (bearish flag, triple top, downtrend, selling trend) reinforce the short-term bearish tone. However, scattered calls for buying or a potential big green candle temper the confidence level to medium.",
