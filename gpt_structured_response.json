    "explanation": "The majority of live opinions indicate strong interest in buying or holding BTC, with mentions of breakouts, pump expectations, and whale accumulation. However, there is also significant caution due to choppy/sideways market conditions, frequent stop loss triggers, and some negative sentiment about recent losses. The presence of a few strong bullish technical signals (e.g., ascending triangle, whale accumulation, and perpetual futures buy signals) supports a buy call, but overall market indecision and mixed short-term sentiment reduce confidence from high to medium.",
