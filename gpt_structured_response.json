    "explanation": "There are mixed but slightly more positive live opinions regarding BTC. Multiple users mention anticipation of new highs, bullish momentum, and upcoming pumps. Some discuss taking long profits, and there's notable hype, but there is also visible short interest, resistance levels, and warnings of volatility. A few mention big moves soon, suggesting active trading opportunities, but the split between long and short sentiment reduces overall confidence. No clear consensus on extreme bullishness or bearishness, but the current 1-minute sentiment leans 'Buy' with medium confidence.",
