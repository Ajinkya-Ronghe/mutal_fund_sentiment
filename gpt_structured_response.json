    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed but lean towards short-term bearishness due to repeated mentions of downtrend, bearish patterns (divergence, triple top), and profit-taking after green candles. Several traders captured profits on short trades, others noted market struggles and consolidation, and some expect further downside or sideways movement. However, there are also a few bullish and neutral opinions, so the overall confidence is medium, not high.",
