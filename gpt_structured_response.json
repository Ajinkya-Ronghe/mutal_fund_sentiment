    "explanation": "There is overwhelming positive sentiment for BTC, with several participants mentioning bullish targets (108,500-119,000+), expectations of new all-time highs, and recommendations to hold or buy on dips. Many are noting the bullish structure on higher timeframes and referencing price bounces at key EMAs and FIB levels. While some mention short-term pullbacks or scalp trades, the consensus leans toward a continued uptrend with strong institutional and retail interest. Negative or short opinions are countered by more numerous and confident bullish voices.",
