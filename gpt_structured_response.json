    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is currently cautious to bearish: multiple users noted downward price targets (e.g., '106800 incoming', '104k incoming', '88k next stop'), and several mentioned short entries and expectations of a drop ('I think we're going to see a big BTC drop again pretty soon', 'Not able to be macro bullish here', 'setting up for dump friday', 'Iâm short $108k'). Some users discussed longing only if support holds, and there is mention of thick money flow still green, but overall, the majority of actionable opinions expect a near-term downward move or are taking profits. The 1-minute candlestick chart is referenced but not clearly bullish; the tone is more about caution, tight stops, and watching for further drops.",
