    "explanation": "The overall sentiment from the live chat is bullish with multiple traders highlighting ongoing or anticipated upward moves, references to bullish chart structure, BTC dominance increases, and discussions of FOMO and all-time high targets. Several traders referenced holding long positions, expecting a pump to 109k-112k, and noted strong buying pressure at current levels. There was minimal negative or neutral sentiment compared to the strong recurring bullish outlook. Some traders did mention local selling areas or possible short-term pullbacks, but these were generally viewed as opportunities to enter or hold longs rather than shift to bearish positions. Safe leverage is set at 20x isolate future perpetual due to the confident, high-momentum environment, but caution is advised with such high leverage.",
