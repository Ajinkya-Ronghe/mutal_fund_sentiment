    "explanation": "Sentiment for BTC is mixed, with more negative/bearish opinions. Multiple traders mention low volume, trendline breaks, and expectations for downward moves (e.g., 'double top, no volume', 'bear indicator', 'proper down', 'short around 109'). Some see short-term bounces or neutral moves, but the consensus leans bearish with hesitation for aggressive shorting. There are also comments that price discovery can start in silence, and some expect upward spikes, but overall risk remains on the downside.",
