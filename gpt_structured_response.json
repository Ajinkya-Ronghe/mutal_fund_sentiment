    "explanation": "The majority of opinions are bullish on BTC, with many referencing successful long trades, expectations for further upward price movement, and strong interest in buying dips. Several users highlight recent breakouts above resistance levels (e.g., $106,500), ongoing pumps, and a consistent uptrend with multiple consecutive green candles. Even comments mentioning volatility or caution are mostly framed in the context of waiting for a better buy entry, not shorting. Some anticipate retracements or consolidations, but the overall sentiment is that dips are buying opportunities. There are also references to high liquidity and institutional accumulation near lower zones, reinforcing confidence in continued upward momentum. No strong negative or neutral consensus is present.",
