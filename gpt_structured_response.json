    "explanation": "The overall sentiment from the live chat is mixed but leans bearish for BTC in the very short term. Multiple participants mention downtrends, major resistance at 108k, large sell volumes, and expectations of further drops to 106k or even 104k. A few bullish or neutral comments exist (e.g., possible support, sideways action, or fireworks for July), but the frequency of negative opinions and warnings about resistance and big sells outweighs the positives. The chat also references manipulation and choppy, indecisive price action, leading to mediumânot highâconfidence in a short-term bearish move. No clear high-conviction consensus for a strong trend, so leverage should be minimal.",
