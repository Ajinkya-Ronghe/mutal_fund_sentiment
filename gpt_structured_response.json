    "explanation": "A large majority of live talk comments are extremely bullish on BTC, mentioning imminent all-time highs (ATH), strong upward momentum, and price targets above 108k-109k. Multiple participants are adding to long positions, expecting explosive upward moves, and referencing technical breakouts. There is robust positive sentiment, with only a few mentions of possible short-term pullbacks or corrections, which are generally viewed as buying opportunities. The overall tone is confident and suggests that even after minor retracements, the market expects further rallies. Some traders discuss leverage and position management, reinforcing the conviction in the upward trend.",
