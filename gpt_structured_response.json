    "explanation": "Despite intraday volatility, the overall sentiment leans bullish for BTC due to its continued dominance, limited supply, and multiple mentions of strong uptrend and support at key levels (e.g., 107k, 108.5k). Many participants recognize BTC as the market leader, expect a bounce after testing support zones, and refer to positive candlestick patterns (hammer, morning star, bullish engulfing, bottom bounce). There are also remarks about potential big moves in the coming weeks and the resilience of BTC even as alts underperform. While some suggest caution or possible short-term retracements, the majority of actionable opinions favor buying on dips or holding long positions. Leverage should be used cautiously, but 20x isolated futures is considered a safe upper bound given the volatile, yet structurally bullish, environment.",
