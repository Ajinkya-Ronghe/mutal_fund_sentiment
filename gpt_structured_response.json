    "explanation": "A majority of community sentiment leans bullish for BTC in the short term. Comments such as 'so close to next leg up', 'the 1min stoch is pointing up we gonna pump hard now', and repeated references to moving 'north' indicate expectations of upward price action. Several users mention strong support at 107k and a possible move to liquidate shorts above 109700. However, there are references to significant sell orders and reminders to use stop losses, suggesting caution and not overwhelming confidence.",

      "Alexis Gonzalez: 109700 is the last of liquidations above us and with this price action it looks quite possible. I bet we go up at least to liquid levels before we see 103500 again",
      "Tiger Eye: Trend line is holding up quite good, if we slip 107 is a strong support",

      "TioRyo: In long trade use stop on the daily or weekly candle. In short trade use stop loss on the last daily or weekly candle. Leverage only on TOPS AND BOTTOM."
