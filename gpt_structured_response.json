    "explanation": "The majority of BTC-related opinions in the live chat are bullish or favor long positions. Multiple users mention BTC breaking resistance levels, setting long orders, or planning to buy on dips. Some mention significant hashrate drops and volatility, but most direct trade recommendations are for long entries or holding. Key resistance and target levels like 109k, 108.5k, and beyond are discussed, and even those mentioning retracements expect bounces or strong upward moves afterward. Short suggestions are minimal and often met with counter-buy opinions. The sentiment is reinforced by both technical and psychological factors (e.g., AI prediction, fib levels, community enthusiasm). Leverage questions also suggest appetite for high-risk trades, and the overall directional view is upward.",
