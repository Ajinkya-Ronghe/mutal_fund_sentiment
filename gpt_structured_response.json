    "explanation": "The majority of opinions referencing BTC suggest caution and an expectation of a price drop or short-term weakness. Several users mention shorting from specific levels (e.g., 107700, 108k), expecting significant downside, or observing bearish signals such as descending channels and potential rejection at resistance. There are a few isolated bullish hopes (e.g., aiming for 109k before rejection), but the overall sentiment leans negative with more mentions of shorting, market weakness, and concerns about macro trends.",
