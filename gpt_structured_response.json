    "explanation": "There is a mix of opinions, but bullish signals dominate: some expect new all-time highs, targets above 108k/109k/114k/120k/122k, and recommend buying or holding. Several mention strong resistance and liquidity walls above, with some caution due to possible short-term volatility and liquidity grabs. The market appears choppy and indecisive in the very short term, but the overall sentiment leans towards upside, especially for longer timeframes.",
