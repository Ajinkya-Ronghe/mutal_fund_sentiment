    "explanation": "Several live participants express short-term caution or bearish bias for BTC, referencing chart patterns (triangles, symmetrical bottoms, head and shoulders, bear fractal) with downside breakout targets (105200, 105350) and warnings about potential drops below 100k. Some expect bounces at lower levels but overall sentiment leans defensive for the immediate term. No clear consensus on a strong upward move in the current 1-minute context, and warnings about liquidity grabs and high leverage further support caution.",
