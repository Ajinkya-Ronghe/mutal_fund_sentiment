    "explanation": "Despite significant bearish sentiment and volatility, there are multiple direct requests for BTC buy/swing entries, mentions of successful long trades, and live recommendations to buy or enter BTC. There are also mentions of trailing stop-losses being hit to lock in profits, and specific upside targets (108500) being called out. Although there is some bearish sentiment and traders discussing shorts, the presence of recent profit-taking on long trades, direct community requests for buy signals, and explicit calls for new upside entries suggest a high-confidence long signal on the 1-minute candlestick. Leverage should be managed due to volatility.",
