    "explanation": "The majority of recent live opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment or anticipate a move higher for BTC. Many are discussing holding long positions, waiting for buy opportunities, and expecting BTC to take upper liquidity or reach higher resistance levels (e.g., 109k/110k/115k). Several traders note that selling pressure is being absorbed and that there is significant spot demand driving the rally, not just leverage. While a few mention possible pullbacks and short-term traps, the consensus is to wait for dips to buy or to remain long. The macro environment and technicals (liquidity zones, demand, and resistance) support an upside move, with few strong bearish signals at this time.",
