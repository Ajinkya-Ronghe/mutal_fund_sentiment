    "explanation": "Sentiment is currently mixed but leans bearish: multiple users mention expectation of further downside, bearish patterns (triple top, bearish flag, dumping), and calls for selling or shorting. There are also bullish and neutral opinions, but negative comments (expecting 100k, 'it will fall so hard', 'fall will till 100k', 'down', 'dump', 'selling trend', 'again it will fall till 100k', 'downtrend') are more frequent and recent. Some traders are holding shorts or asking about holding through drawdowns. There is caution about FOMO and warnings of psychology traps. However, a minority still discuss support, upside, or holding for a bounce.",
