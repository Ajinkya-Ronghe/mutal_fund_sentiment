    "explanation": "Despite recent volatility and mixed short-term opinions, there is a strong consensus for a bullish move in BTC after retesting support zones. Multiple users discuss key support/resistance levels (e.g., 106200, 103k, 107k), with several stating intentions to enter long positions on confirmed signals or after specific USDT dominance metrics. Some warn of near-term downside, but the prevailing view is to buy dips and expect continuation to higher price targets (e.g., 102-103k, 109k, 110k). Advice also references technical signals (trendlines, support holds, candlestick closes) and market psychology, all supporting a long bias. Notably, traders recommend high leverage, and several consider buying opportunities after flushes or 'trap' moves, indicating confidence in upward recovery.",
