    "explanation": "Despite short-term volatility and mixed opinions, the majority of active traders and analysts in the live chat are discussing entries for long positions, support and bounce zones, and expectations of upside continuation. There is repeated mention of BTC's dominance and resilience, with many referencing recent dips as buying opportunities and holding for higher targets (e.g., 108k, 108500). Psychological support levels (107000, 106800) and bullish technical signals (candle patterns, bullish structure, 'king' status) are cited. Negative or short calls are present but are met by more long-side reasoning or warnings against shorting prematurely. Some traders also mention high leverage and successful scalping on longs, while neutral sentiments are outnumbered by positive outlooks.",
