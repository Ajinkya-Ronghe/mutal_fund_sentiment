One participant mentions a support at 107210 and a thesis to take short positions, while another echoes that a hard short is coming. However, there are also bullish opinions about long-term prospects (e.g., 'buy like Saylor'), and some neutral or technical banter, so the overall confidence is medium rather than high.",
