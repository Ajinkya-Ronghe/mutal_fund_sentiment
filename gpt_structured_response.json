    "explanation": "Multiple participants noted BTC strength, fast upward moves (e.g., 'btc 108k was super fast like a blink', 'btc breakout hai', 'btc to bhaag rha h'), bullish sentiment on dips ('buy the dips'), and several direct buy calls including 'all go buy now big buy now', 'buy now', and 'Nice time to buy some BTC'. Rejection at 108k is noted, but the majority of opinions anticipate further upside, mentioning potential targets like 111k and 122k. There is some caution about supply levels and possible short-term corrections, but the bullish momentum is dominant.",
