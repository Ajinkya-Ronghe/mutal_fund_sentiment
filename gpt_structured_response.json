    "explanation": "There is mixed sentiment from the live chat: some participants speculate about a further dump or retracement, but others see support at 106.8k and expect a bounce. Multiple users mention waiting for a trade or support at lower levels, while some claim a large $14B BTC buy is coming and a few encourage long positions. However, hesitation and calls to wait are also present, so confidence is not high. Technical mentions of support at 106.2k-106.8k and anticipation of a bounce provide a moderate bias toward a long, but the overall tone is cautious.",
