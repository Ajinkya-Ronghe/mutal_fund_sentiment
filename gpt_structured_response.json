Multiple comments emphasize the risk of going long and prefer shorting or waiting, with mentions of trendline rejection and fakeouts. There are also suggestions for tight stop losses, indicating caution. While a few bullish voices exist (e.g., 'bulls in charge'), the majority opinion is wary or negative.",
