    "explanation": "The live chat reflects a largely bullish bias on BTC, with discussions of anticipated pumps, all-time highs, and positive sentiment such as 'rocket is fueling up,' 'bull flag daily,' and 'buy now or cry later.' There are also several remarks about BTC holding above key support levels, expected liquidations of shorts, and calls for a big move higher (e.g., 'big pump coming soon,' 'moondance'). However, there are also counter-opinions noting possible sweeping of lows, 'struggling to go over 65.77%,' and some uncertainty before daily closes. Overall, the majority is positive or expectant of upward movement, with a fair number of neutral or cautious comments and a few bearish/short remarks.",
