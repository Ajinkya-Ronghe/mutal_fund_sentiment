    "explanation": "Across a large number of comments, BTC is seen as resilient, with multiple users mentioning strong buy zones, holding or adding to positions, and a lack of strong downside conviction. Sentiment is mixed short-term, with some suggesting scalp shorts or reacting to rapid moves, but the dominant narrative is bullish or holding for higher targets (some mentioning 109300, 115k, and even much higher for the future). Several are asking about re-entry points and swing trades to the upside, with users expressing regret at not buying earlier or being told to wait before entering. Overall, the majority of actionable comments lean toward accumulation, holding, or buying on dips, with only a few advocating shorts for quick trades. Large positive crowd engagement, repeated questions about when to buy, and support for long positions indicate high confidence for a buy signal at current or slightly lower levels, using up to 20x leverage on isolated perpetual futures for experienced traders.",
