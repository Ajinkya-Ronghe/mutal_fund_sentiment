    "explanation": "The live chat reflects a highly mixed sentiment with a slight bearish tilt. Multiple participants mention strong sell signals, bearish flags, sellers' control, and expectations of further dumping or a drop to 104k. Some expect major resistance at 108k and highlight absorption of buyers by limit sellers. However, there are also a few bullish and dip-buying comments, and some suggest a rebound or volatility ahead. The overall picture is choppy, but near-term signals and community sentiment lean more toward caution and downside, especially for short-term trades.",
