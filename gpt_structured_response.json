    "explanation": "Several participants discussed BTC price action, with references to taking profit, the 1-minute candle closing below resistance, and support levels around 107230-107290. No strong bullish sentiment or major fundamental catalyst was noted; instead, some scalping and short-term short ideas were discussed. There is little consensus on a strong directional move, but the immediate candlestick and resistance comments suggest a cautious short-term bearish stance.",
