    "explanation": "The overall sentiment for BTC is bullish with multiple users referencing upward targets (e.g., 109300, 110k, 115k, and much higher), reports of large profits from recent long positions, and direct comments stating BTC 'will never go down' and 'is going rocket.' Positive technicals are mentioned, such as cup and handle patterns, bullish divergences, and support bounces. While some shorts and cautionary voices exist, the bullish sentiment notably outweighs them. Powell's testimony and macroeconomic factors like rate cut expectations are also seen as upside catalysts. The count of positive opinions, strong upward momentum, and lack of significant new bearish technical arguments support a high-confidence buy recommendation with a 1-minute candlestick long bias. Safe leverage suggested by the community is up to 20x isolated perpetuals.",
