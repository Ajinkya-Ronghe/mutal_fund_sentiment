    "explanation": "Despite a strong presence of short and bearish sentiment in the chat, there are notable signals of bullish momentum and key technical breakouts (e.g., breaking $106,500, references to grinding higher, and anticipation of rallies). Several traders note that big investors are active, and there is mention of holding above resistance levels as critical for further upside. The market shows volatility, but with a large number of participants considering both long and short entries, the risk-reward for a 1-minute long scalp is favorable. The recommendation is to use isolated margin with careful leverage (20x) and strict stop-loss management due to volatility and mixed retail sentiment.",
