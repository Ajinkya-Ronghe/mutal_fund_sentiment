    "explanation": "The majority of live participants and signal providers are bullish on BTC, citing several factors: multiple references to short-term bullish price action (e.g., 'pump in next 4 hrs', 'bullish news', 'Bullish formation', 'Powell remarks a crypto green light'), numerous calls for fresh or current long entries, and technical patterns like falling wedge and bullish candlestick signals. Some users are holding through volatility, and recent institutional news (Powell's remarks) is fueling optimism. Despite a few short-side comments, the overall sentiment is positive, with many asking for entry points and expecting upward moves toward 108,500 and beyond. Scalping and short-term trading with high leverage is frequently discussed, with 20x leverage seen as a safe but aggressive approach.",
