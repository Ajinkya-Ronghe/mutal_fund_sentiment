    "explanation": "Several opinions point to BTC recently topping out near 108k and failing to hold above it, with some users noting a reversal and smart money selling. There is mention of a strong support at 107k, but the prevailing sentiment after the failed breakout is negative or cautious. While a few users are still holding or calling to buy, the majority reflect disappointment or suggest exiting after a failed rally.",
