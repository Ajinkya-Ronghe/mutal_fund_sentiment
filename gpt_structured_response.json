    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed but bullish momentum dominates: multiple users expect new all-time highs (ATH), targets of 109k, 110k, 111k, and even 120k are mentioned. There is strong discussion about spot buying, and several queries about when to enter long. Some caution and talk of shorting or pullbacks exist, but the overall vibe is that dips are buying opportunities. Hashrate concerns are quickly dismissed by others, and the majority express optimism about the next market move post-NY open. High leverage is discussed. Representative opinions include expectations of breakouts, strong upside, and continued bullishness.",
