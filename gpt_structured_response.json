    "explanation": "Despite mixed opinions and notable volatility, BTC sentiment shows strong buy-side interest for active trading. Multiple users reference successful long trades, ask about new long entries, and see profit opportunities on upward momentum. Some anticipate dumps or corrections, but the majority of actionable advice amid the noise, especially from live traders, is to buy dips or go long. There's also frequent discussion around key breakout levels (106,500-108,900), and overall, the active trading community is looking for upward continuation after breakouts. Scalping and swing opportunities are highlighted, but high leverage and volatility caution is advised.",
