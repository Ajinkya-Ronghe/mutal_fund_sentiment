    "explanation": "Multiple participants noted BTC's recent strong upward momentum, potential for all-time highs, and resilience compared to weak altcoins. Live signals and trade ideas support a long bias, with some traders highlighting liquidity grabs and elevator-like price action. While profit-taking and volatility are expected near news events (e.g., Powell speech), the overall consensus is bullish with active recommendations for holding or entering long positions. Suggested leverage levels (1:20) were discussed as safe for such moves. Both retail and signal providers are actively calling for upside targets and continued bullish structure.",
