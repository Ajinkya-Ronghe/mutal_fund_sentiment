    "explanation": "Across the opinions, there is a strong sentiment of BTC support holding at current levels, multiple calls for price targets above current prices (e.g., 108500, 109100, 115k, ATH), and mentions of trendline breakouts and swing buying zones. Despite some short-term uncertainty and stop losses being hit, the majority of actionable opinions point towards a bounce and new highs, especially with references to liquidity sweeps and strong buy-the-dip mentality. Multiple users report recent buys at support and are holding, expecting upward movement. The market is choppy but consolidating above support, with visible bullish bias on higher timeframes and high engagement around upward targets. Safe leverage is recommended at 20x due to ongoing volatility but with strong uptrend bias.",
