    "explanation": "Sentiment is slightly bullish, with repeated references to institutional buying (BlackRock, governments, corporations), expectations of new highs, and discussions about potential price surges if the dollar weakens. However, there is notable skepticism regarding rapid increases (e.g., BTC to 125k today is dismissed), and some users anticipate corrections or volatility (mentions of 105k, 108.2k, 86k, triangle patterns). There is no clear short-term candlestick signal, but overall crowd bias leans to holding or buying for longer-term upside.",
