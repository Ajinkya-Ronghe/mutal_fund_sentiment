    "explanation": "The majority of sentiment in the live chat is cautious or bearish for BTC, with recurring themes of 'smart money selling,' concerns about failing to hold above 108k, and warnings of an incoming big short if key levels are not maintained. There are also repeated mentions of significant risk-taking and skepticism about further bullish moves. However, a minority of comments remain optimistic, referencing institutional support and BTC's resilience, lending some balance to the outlook.",
