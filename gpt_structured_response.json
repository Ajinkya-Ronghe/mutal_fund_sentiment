    "explanation": "A large number of comments indicate positive sentiment, strong technical levels, and expectations of new all-time highs. Multiple users are discussing bullish technicals (stochastic RSI, trendline, and daily/4h charts), positive correlations with tech stocks, and targets above current price (e.g., 108500, 110k, 120k, 140k, even 1 million). While some short signals and skepticism exist, the majority opinion leans bullish, with traders looking for long entries and holding through minor dips. The confidence is high due to technical confluence and market structure, with many seeking leverage and expressing FOMO on upside moves. The safe leverage for isolate future perpetual trades is set at 20x based on typical risk management discussed for high-confidence BTC moves.",
