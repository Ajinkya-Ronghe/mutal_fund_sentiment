    "explanation": "Multiple live chat participants are actively discussing long entries, upside targets (108500+), and confirming strong buying or holding positions. Signals include momentum trades, breakouts, and market structure favoring further upside. Although some mention possible shorts at local highs and warn of volatility, the overall sentiment is bullish for BTC, especially on lower time frames. There is repeated mention of successful profits from long positions, holding for second targets, and signals that BTC is outperforming alts. Caution is advised at resistance zones (108700), but the majority anticipate further upward movement, making this a high-confidence long recommendation.",
