    "explanation": "There is a notable split in sentiment with considerable bearish signals such as 'bear flag', 'bear hopium at critical mass', and 'huge sell volume when it hits', along with traders discussing price traps and upcoming dumps. Several expect BTC to fall to support levels (e.g., 104k), and some mention overleveraged longs getting liquidated. However, there is still some bullish sentiment and talk of possible rebounds, which tempers the confidence.",
