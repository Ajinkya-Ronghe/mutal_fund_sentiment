    "explanation": "Despite high volatility and some opinions suggesting short-term weakness or confusion, the majority of crowd sentiment references key support zones and buying opportunities around 107k-109k, with calls for bottom bounces, liquidity sweeps, and new long entries. Several users mention BTC dominance over alts and a focus on buying dips or adding quantity. Positive momentum is further supported by technical mentions (EMA crossovers, Bollinger Band bounces), bullish reversals, and explicit calls for buy signals. Negative sentiment, while present (trap, fakeouts, calls for shorting), is less frequent and often quickly countered by positive or neutral perspectives. The overall tone is that BTC is in a corrective phase, offering an attractive buy opportunity for the next leg up.",
