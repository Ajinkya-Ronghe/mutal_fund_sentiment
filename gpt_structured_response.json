    "explanation": "Majority of the opinions suggest an overall bullish trend for BTC with several mentions of strong buying momentum, expectations of new all-time highs, and targets above 109k and 111k. Positive sentiment is reinforced by large buy orders, news of institutional buying, and buyers holding positions. Pullbacks and minor dips are mentioned, but the bias remains to the upside, especially in the short term. Technical mentions include bullish volume, upward momentum, and confirmation from multiple timeframes (1-min, 15-min, 1-hr, H4). While some anticipate dips or recommend caution at local tops, the prevailing view is to hold or buy on pullbacks. Leverage is discussed as safe up to 20x on isolated perpetuals due to high confidence in trend continuation.",
