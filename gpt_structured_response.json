    "explanation": "Majority of opinions indicate BTC is experiencing strong moves upwards, with phrases like 'straight line up since 99k', 'all green', 'roughly another 1k more and all resistance is gone', and 'Broke $106500 nice!'. There is significant excitement and anticipation of further gains, and some mention profit-taking and holding for higher levels. While there are a few concerns about possible dumps or retracements, the dominant sentiment is bullish. Some even discuss entering at current levels or holding ongoing long trades. Only a minority voice caution or retracement expectations, and discussions of trading strategy (scalp, swing, leverage) are positive for buy-side trades.",
