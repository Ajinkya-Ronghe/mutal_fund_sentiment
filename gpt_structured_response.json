    "explanation": "BTC received both bullish and bearish comments, but recent 1-minute sentiment is slightly more positive. Multiple users mention breakouts, upside movement, and buying opportunities (e.g., 'Next move 112-113k btc hosakta bhai', 'btc upside ja sakta hai', 'Buy BTC , ETH, ETC, ... and hold!', 'Trading Crusader: Itâs BTC time. Then btc falls to $104k. And holds while alts rally!'). Some warn of corrections and temporary dumps, but trend-following and breakout strategies are favored by several participants. The confidence is set to medium due to notable short-term volatility and mixed signals.",
