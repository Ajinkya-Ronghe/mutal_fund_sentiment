    "explanation": "Despite some short-term bearish sentiment and profit-taking, the majority of community sentiment and technical observations highlight that BTC is holding support zones, shows resilience after dips, and is expected to bounce back toward higher targets (108,000â115,000). Many traders discuss waiting for dips to buy, the dominance of BTC in the market, and expectations of price recovery after the recent drop. There is significant discussion about support levels (106,800, 107,000) and bullish patterns forming on multiple time frames. The market is volatile but the consensus leans towards BTC recovering and moving up, with several users explicitly asking about or recommending long entries. The risk appetite is high, and 20x leverage is mentioned as suitable by multiple users. There are also opinions that altcoins will only rally after BTC dominance drops, suggesting continued BTC strength in the near term.",
