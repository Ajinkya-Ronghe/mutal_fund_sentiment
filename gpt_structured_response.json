    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bullish: multiple users discuss breakouts above resistance, push for higher levels (e.g., 108k, 110k, 122k), and mention of institutional buying (FINK). There are some concerns about resistance at 108k and possible pullbacks, but the majority of recent chat leans toward upward momentum or aggressive long entries. Some users mention taking profits or waiting for liquidity sweeps, indicating caution is warranted. Overall, the recommendation is to buy with moderate confidence, using low leverage due to volatility, and to monitor resistance zones closely.",
