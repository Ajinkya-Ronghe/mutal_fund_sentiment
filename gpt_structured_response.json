    "explanation": "Despite significant short-term bearish sentiment and reports of volatility, there are multiple contrarian signals suggesting an impending bullish reversal. Several traders mention key buy zones around 106k-107k, algorithmic buy signals near current levels, and expectations of a bounce to higher targets (108k+). There is persistent demand and trader discipline on the long side, with some warnings against shorting at current levels. The overall market sentiment is choppy, but BTC's limited supply and dominance narrative remain strong. While short-term price action includes both bullish and bearish calls, the most actionable and repeated opinions from experienced voices favor a buy on dips with targets at or above 108k. Use high but manageable leverage with strict risk controls due to volatility.",
