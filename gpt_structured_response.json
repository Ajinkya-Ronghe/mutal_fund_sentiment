Some mention government accumulation and positive macro, but these are outweighed by more immediate short-term bearish/neutral opinions and repeated calls for shorting near local highs. Multiple users cite volume weakness, risk of fake breakouts, and manipulation, with only a few calling for an imminent pump.",
