    "explanation": "The sentiment is mixed but leans slightly bullish. Several comments mention strong buying, expectations of a pump, and whales accumulating for a big move up. However, there are notable concerns about sideways action, fakeouts, and potential for a drop. Still, the number of positive and neutral comments slightly outweighs the negatives, with frequent mentions of buying, holding, and expecting an upside move. No clear consensus on high leverage, so a safe, low leverage approach is appropriate.",
