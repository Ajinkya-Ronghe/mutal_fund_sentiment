    "explanation": "Multiple participants reference recent short-term rejections for BTC at the 1-minute and 5-minute timeframes, with talk of 'trap' setups and warnings against longing until a retracement. Technical analysis mentions include double tops, rejection at high average weekly range, and the need for a pullback before new longs. However, some mention the overall uptrend and patience, which slightly moderates the bearish case. Overall, the short-term sentiment is cautious to bearish, with a preference to wait for a clear retracement before considering new long positions.",
