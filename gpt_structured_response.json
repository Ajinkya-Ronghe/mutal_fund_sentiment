    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term sentiment and some calls for shorting or pullbacks, the dominant narrative from the live chat is that BTC is holding key levels, showing resilience against sell pressure, and is expected to break higher toward 108,500 and possibly beyond, with repeated references to bullish structures, liquidity grabs to the upside, and FOMO. Multiple users mention swing holds, waiting for new buy entries, and that the broader trend remains bullish. Several chat members reported taking profit on longs, and liquidity above current price is repeatedly discussed. There were also mentions of bear traps and the market shaking out weak hands. Short-term volatility exists, but the consensus is for further upside in the near term.",
