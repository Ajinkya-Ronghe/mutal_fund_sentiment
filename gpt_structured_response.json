    "explanation": "Multiple opinions point to uncertainty and a slight bearish bias in the very short term for BTC. Traders discuss downside targets (105200, 105350), failed trendline holds, bearish fractals, and head-and-shoulders patterns. However, there is also mention of support, potential for a bounce, and indecisiveness, so confidence is not high. No clear consensus for a strong bullish move in the immediate minute timeframe.",
