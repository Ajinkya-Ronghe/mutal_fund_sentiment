    "explanation": "Despite significant debate and both bullish and bearish intraday sentiment, there is a strong presence of traders buying the dip, algorithmic buy signals near 108k, and several comments indicating major support levels holding around 104k-106k. Multiple users discuss entering longs on liquidity grabs and after retesting key zones, and there is consistent mention of holding BTC for both intraday and longer-term setups. Some opinions highlight temporary downside risk (retests to 102k-104k), but the active closing of shorts, new long entries, and algorithmic buy signals outweigh negatives, suggesting a high-confidence long bias for the next 1-minute candlestick. The crowd expects a bounce or recovery from recent dips, especially if USDT.D dominance falls or holds at the 5% zone, and macro news supports potential upside.",
