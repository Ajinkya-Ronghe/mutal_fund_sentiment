    "explanation": "The prevailing sentiment is caution after a recent uptrend. Several traders note a rejection at key levels on the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 1-hour charts, with warnings about potential traps for long positions and the need for a retracement before longing. There are concerns about a possible drop below 105k and references to double tops and rejections at high averages. However, some bullish opinions exist regarding long-term upside, but near-term signals and market structure favor a short or at least caution before new buys.",
