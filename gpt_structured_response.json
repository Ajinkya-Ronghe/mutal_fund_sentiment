    "explanation": "Sentiment is largely bullish with multiple calls for a continued uptrend, price breakouts, and new highs. Technical signals support further upsideâ4h and daily stochastics are pushing into bullish zones, and breaking above resistance levels (106,500, 107,100) points to further gains. There is some mention of caution about liquidity sweeps and possible pullbacks, but most opinions are in favor of holding or entering longs, especially on dips. The correlation with bullish NASDAQ/tech stocks is also supporting sentiment. Representative opinions recommend buying or holding, expecting moves towards 108k, 110k, and new highs, with tight stop-losses for risk management.",
