    "explanation": "Across the live chat, there is an overall bullish sentiment for BTC, with multiple users suggesting buying or holding. Several opinions mention strong support around 106,500â105,000 and the potential for a pump. Some traders are waiting for a breakout, and others mention that institutions and retails are trapped, indicating possible upward volatility. Notably, multiple participants ask about new BTC entries, with some confirming recent profitable trades and others suggesting to 'go long' or 'hold'. There are notes of selling pressure and short-term volatility, but these are outnumbered by buy/hold recommendations, and no new negative catalysts are mentioned. The leverage advice among users is aggressive, but for safe recommendation, 20x is suggested for isolated perpetual futures. The positive-to-negative comment ratio is heavily in favor of bullish/buying sentiment.",
