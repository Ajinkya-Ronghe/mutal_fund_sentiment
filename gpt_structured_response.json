    "explanation": "Sentiment is leaning bearish, with several traders mentioning expectations of a big drop, weak momentum, and failed bullish pushes. Key levels like 108k and 107,500 are discussed as resistance or short entry points. Some expect retests lower (104k, 102,200, even 88k mentioned). However, a minority expect a bounce or slow move up, so confidence is not high.",
