    "explanation": "There is a high volume of opinions expressing caution or bearishness for BTC in the near term. Several users mention upcoming drops (e.g., 106800, 104k, 102200 targets), and multiple traders are shorting from the 107,700 to 108,600 levels. Concerns about weak bullish momentum, a lack of strong bullish divergence, and the risk of a crash are noted. While some hold or expect a bounce, the majority sentiment for the immediate short-term is defensive or bearish.",
