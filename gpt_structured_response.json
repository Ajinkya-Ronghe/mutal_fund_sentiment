    "explanation": "The majority of public sentiment and live chat discussions are bullish on BTC, with many traders expressing strong buy interest, expecting new all-time highs and further pumps. Although some are holding shorts or discussing short-term pullbacks, positive momentum is reinforced by mainstream financial news (e.g., Federal Reserve Chair Powell's comments on banks and crypto freedom), recent breakouts of resistance levels (e.g., $106,500), and multiple mentions of waiting for higher targets ($108,800, $112,000, even $150,000). Liquidity and FOMO are repeatedly referenced, with many expressing regret for missing out on earlier long entries. Short-term volatility is acknowledged, but the consensus is upward bias, especially after key news events and technical confirmations.",
