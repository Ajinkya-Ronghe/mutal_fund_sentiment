    "explanation": "There is a strong split in sentiment with many traders noting resistance, potential for a dump, and selling pressure. Some mention bullish candles on longer timeframes, but 1-minute signals and overall chat sentiment lean towards caution and shorting. There are repeated mentions of dumping, failed higher lows, and absorption of market buyers by limit sellers. The risk of stop loss hunting by big players is also highlighted.",
