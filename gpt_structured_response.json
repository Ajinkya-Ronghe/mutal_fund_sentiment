    "explanation": "Despite a highly mixed sentiment with frequent references to both shorting and long trades, several representative opinions and technical call-outs indicate bullish structure on higher timeframes and specific long trade signals. Notable mentions include direct long entries with targets, bullishness above key resistance levels, and comments about institutional activity. The market appears to be volatile with some advocating for shorts due to rejections or recent dumps; however, the overall trend, as indicated by multiple sources, and the breaking and holding above critical resistance, supports a high-confidence long signal. Safe leverage is set at 20x isolated futures perpetual due to market volatility and mixed retail sentiment, but overall institutional and technical cues favor a long bias.",
