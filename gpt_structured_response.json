    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate bullishness for BTC, with repeated requests for entry signals, discussions of support levels (e.g., 106500, 107000, 108500), and direct calls for buying or holding long positions. There are references to bullish technical patterns, such as wedge formations and higher highs, as well as sentiment that institutional and retail traders are trapped in shorts. Several users express a desire to enter or re-enter BTC longs, and others report successful profits or targets being hit on the upside. While some mention shorting or minor retracements, the overall sentiment is dominated by a buy/long bias, especially on intraday and lower time frames, supported by positive reactions to news and technical analysis. The few negative or neutral remarks are outweighed by the clear market demand for buy signals and upward targets.",
