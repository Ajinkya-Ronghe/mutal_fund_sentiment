    "explanation": "The opinions are mixed with several market participants suggesting to buy BTC on dips, dollar-cost-average, or hold for the long-term, while a few others mention short-term price drops and large fluctuations. The strongest actionable recommendation is to buy or accumulate BTC, especially when the market is sideways or showing dips. There is no strong consensus for high confidence due to some warnings about volatility and possible further drops. The 1-minute candlestick sentiment is slightly bullish, but with caution due to volatility.",
