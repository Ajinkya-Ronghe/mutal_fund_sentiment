Several users reference price targets above current levels (e.g., 107200, 108700, 111900, 140k by November) and holding, with some bullish technical indicators (MACD turning bullish, EMA mentioned as 'money glitch'). However, there is notable caution, profit-taking, and some short/neutral mentions, resulting in a medium rather than high confidence rating.",
