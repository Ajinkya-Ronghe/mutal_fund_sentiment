    "explanation": "Despite a prevailing short-term bearish sentiment with many traders mentioning shorts at levels like 108k and 107k, there is notable evidence of profit-booking, short covering, and some turning long at current levels. Multiple users report switching to long, referencing algorithmic buy calls, and expecting support zones to hold. There is also talk of a possible bounce and 'buy the dip' sentiment, as well as references to upcoming macroeconomic catalysts (e.g., Fed, China liquidity) that are generally supportive. Short liquidations at 106,700 and below have already occurred, and some traders explicitly mention entering or recommending long positions. The 1-minute candle is showing signs of a reversal, and several opinions suggest the market may have overreacted to the downside, making this an attractive buy opportunity with a strong risk/reward setup.",
