    "explanation": "Across live opinions, BTC is showing strong bullish bias with repeated mentions of liquidity grabs to the upside, spot buying fueling rallies, macro shifts (like dropping bond yields and increasing liquidity) supporting upward movement, and multiple traders confirming long positions or holding for higher targets (109kâ112k+). While some mention possible short-term pullbacks or liquidity sweeps before new all-time highs, the overall sentiment is for price continuation upwards. Technical signals such as breakouts, retests, and bullish formations on low time frames (1-min, 15-min) are highlighted, along with positive macroeconomic context. Negative/neutral comments exist (calls for shorting/traps), but are outweighed by the number and conviction of bullish opinions.",
