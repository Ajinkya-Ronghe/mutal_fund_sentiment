    "explanation": "Despite some opinions predicting sharp dumps or major resistance around 108kâ110k, there is a broad consensus that BTC is resilient, with strong liquidity and support levels around 105kâ107k, and charts on all trend timeframes still showing green. Many participants mention consolidation, potential for new highs if no further negative macro news appears, and active accumulation as alts are sold for BTC. Even amidst volatility and mixed short-term calls, the prevailing sentiment is that BTC will remain strong or move higher, with several users suggesting targets of 108,500 or even 110,000. The majority of negative or bearish opinions are balanced by equally strong bullish and neutral takes, leading to a high-confidence buy recommendation with a focus on safe, isolated leverage.",
