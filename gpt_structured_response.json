There is some disagreement and uncertainty with a few traders expressing conviction for holding longs, but the weight of sentiment and warnings about liquidation zones and manipulation adds bearish pressure. The lack of clear bullish catalysts and repeated references to short-term risk support a cautious short bias for BTC.",
