    "explanation": "BTC opinions show a mixed but overall bullish sentiment with several mentions of 'fly to the moon', breaking key resistance levels, and suggestions to 'buy now'. Some discuss potential for volatility and wait for daily closes, but the bias is towards upward moves and alertness for further rises. Perpetual signals are not strongly leveraged, and while there are a few concerns about possible dumps or consolidations, the buy side is more represented.",
