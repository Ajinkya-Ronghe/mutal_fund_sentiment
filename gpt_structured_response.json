    "explanation": "The majority of live chat participants are bullish on BTC, pointing to current upward price action, expectations of further pumps, and retests of higher resistance levels (107k, 108k, 109k, and targets up to 111-112k). There is also mention of buy entries, positive institutional news (Fidelity, ETF mentions), and references to rate cuts being bullish for crypto. Some are waiting for pullbacks or retracements for re-entry, but sentiment is largely positive with several calls to go long or hold. The number of buy/long mentions, questions about when to enter, and affirmation from experienced members suggest strong confidence in further upside. Leverage suggestions and live feedback also support aggressive trading strategies, but with reminders about risk management.",
