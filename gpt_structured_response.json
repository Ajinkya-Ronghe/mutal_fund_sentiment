    "explanation": "BTC is experiencing mixed but overall bullish sentiment. Multiple users are discussing key resistance and support levels (e.g., 106,500, 108,000, 104,000), with several comments noting uptrend continuation, bullish stochastics, and a possible push to new ATH if resistance is broken. While there are short attempts and profit-taking, the majority of technical opinions and live signals suggest holding or entering long positions, especially above 106,500. Some traders mention manipulation and potential retracements, but the prevailing view is to buy dips and expect higher highs, especially as tech stocks rally and macro news is supportive.",
