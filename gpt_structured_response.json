    "explanation": "The majority of opinions express a bullish sentiment, referencing an uptrend, a potential bull flag breakout, and expectations of a significant move upward. However, notable caution and bearish counterpoints exist, including concerns about a possible bull trap, profit-taking at resistance, and market indecision. This mix results in a medium confidence level. The 1-minute candlestick signal is 'long' due to short-term bullish momentum, but with some risk of reversal.",
