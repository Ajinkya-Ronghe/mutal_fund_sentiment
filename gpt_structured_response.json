    "explanation": "Despite some market hesitation and previous short targets, the majority of real-time opinions now lean bullish for BTC, especially for short-term scalping and swing entries. Many users are reporting or anticipating upward movement toward 107,000â108,500, with several referencing missed dumps and bounce expectations. There is strong community engagement to buy dips and hold for a potential breakout, and repeated requests for confirmation or entry signals are being met with buy-side encouragement. Some are holding for further upside, and risk-seeking traders are already taking long positions. A few negative voices exist, but they're overwhelmed by the optimism and rapid buy-side calls following any dips.",
