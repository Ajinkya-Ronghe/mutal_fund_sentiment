    "explanation": "The overall sentiment in the live chat leans bearish with repeated calls to 'sell', references to price drops, and comments about miner selling pressure and possible further downside. While some users mention potential bounce areas and hope for a long at lower levels, the prevailing tone is cautious or negative. There is no clear consensus for a bullish move in the immediate term, and discussions of support breakdowns, lack of bull flag patterns, and miner selling all weigh towards a short-term sell signal.",
