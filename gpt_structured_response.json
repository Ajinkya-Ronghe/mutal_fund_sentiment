Opinions about bounce possibilities exist, but the short-term tone is more negative, referencing dumping due to DXY strength, market makers' actions, and targets below current prices. There are also discussions about setting stop losses and possible fakeouts, reflecting uncertainty but a tilt toward downside risk.",
