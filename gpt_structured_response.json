    "explanation": "The overall sentiment on BTC in the opinions is neutral to mildly bearish, with traders discussing shorting, choppy and uncertain price action, lower support levels, and a possible fake-out before a larger dump. A few expect a downward move before a bounce, referencing support zones and miners selling. There is no strong consensus for a bullish move and more participants are cautious or shorting in the near-term.",
