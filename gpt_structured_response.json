    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Across numerous comments, BTC is consistently referred to as the dominant asset, with many participants discussing long entries, bounce expectations, and price targets above current levels (e.g., 108500, 109000, 110000, and even 200k). The sentiment, despite some bearish voices, is overwhelmingly positive with strong support for buying dips and holding long. Several specific trade calls and algorithmic buy signals further reinforce the bullish bias. While some mention caution due to resistance zones and engulfing candles, the majority of actionable opinions are on the long/buy side. Technical mentions of dominance, limited supply, and market structure also support a bullish thesis. The negative and neutral opinions are mostly outweighed by the positive calls and confirmations.",
