    "explanation": "A majority of the comments express bullish sentiment for BTC, with repeated mentions of breakouts above major resistance levels (108k, 108500), references to 'ATH' (all-time high), and excitement about upward moves. Traders suggest holding or buying, with several stating to 'go long', 'never look back', and 'BTC boom'. Some mention short-term retracements but the overall mood is strongly positive, supported by both technical (breakout, resistance break) and sentiment-driven cues (FOMO, 'mooning', 'lambos'). There are occasional short recommendations around the 108k level, but these are outnumbered by bullish opinions and are often followed by statements that BTC quickly regained or broke through those levels. Leverage discussions and questions about proper risk indicate active trading interest, with some participants recommending up to 20x leverage. On-chain data mention (e.g., low Binance inflows, 'strong hands') further supports the bullish case.",
