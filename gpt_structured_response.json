    "explanation": "There is heavy discussion about BTC's market dominance, with many referring to BTC as the 'king' and the main driver of market capital. Multiple users commented on strong bullish structures, expectations of price recovery, and the 'buyish' nature of the market at current levels. Several users mentioned recent bullish engulfing candles, higher lows, and the need to 'hold' or 'go long.' Some expressed caution around resistance (notably 108k), but the overall sentiment is that BTC remains the primary asset to accumulate, especially given its limited supply compared to alts. Even with minor retracements, the majority expects continued upward movement, and there is a high number of live confirmations of long entries and buy signals. Representative opinions strongly lean bullish, with very few advocating shorts or expressing concern.",
