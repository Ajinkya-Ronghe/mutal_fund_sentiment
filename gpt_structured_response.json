There are mixed signals, but more negative/neutral sentiment: some mention short signals, confluence with bearish indicators (VWAP, Ichimoku), and the need to retest support. Bullish targets (111k, 109.6) are mentioned, but are not consensus; immediate chart signals and participant comments point toward caution or possible short-term downside.",
