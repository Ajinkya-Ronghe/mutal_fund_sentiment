    "explanation": "A significant majority of opinions express bullish expectations for BTC, with multiple users discussing long entries, targets above current prices (108k, 109k, 113k, 119k), and anticipation of new highs. There is active interest in buying on pullbacks, and traders are booking profits on the upside. Although there are mentions of possible pullbacks or short-term corrections, the prevailing sentiment remains strongly positive, with expectations of further upside, new all-time highs, and strong momentum. Several technical references to key levels, Fibonacci retracements, and EMA support reinforce the bullish thesis. A 20x leverage on isolated futures is seen as safe by experienced community members.",
