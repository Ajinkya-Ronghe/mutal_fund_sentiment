    "explanation": "Sentiment is cautiously bullish, with several participants discussing potential support zones (105k-107k), confirming bounce from daily open, and expressing reluctance to sell BTC. While there are some concerns about possible short-term downside (bear fractal, head and shoulders), the overall tone favors a recovery from lower levels, with targets for a move higher if certain support holds. No clear short signals dominate, and traders express that no one is selling their BTC at the bottom.",
