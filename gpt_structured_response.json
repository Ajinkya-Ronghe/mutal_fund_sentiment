    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed but lean slightly bullish with several users discussing potential upside targets (107k+, 109k+), calls to hold above specific daily levels, and technical patterns like bull flag and symmetrical triangle suggesting uptrend continuation. However, there are also notable calls for selling or shorting at specific levels (108k) and warnings about choppy/boring price action. Short-term signals favor holding or buying with caution, using low leverage and strict risk management due to volatility and mixed sentiment.",
