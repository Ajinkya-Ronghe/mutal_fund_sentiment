    "explanation": "The majority of BTC-specific opinions indicate bearish sentiment, short positions, or expectations of further price drops. Comments discuss support levels (e.g., 107128), daily new supply from miners, increased liquidations above 108k, and the possibility of slow downward movement or further dumps. There are short entries and concerns about chart patterns (no bull flag, dislike of the 4hr chart), and targets below current price are mentioned. A minority anticipate a bounce or a 'juicey long' at lower levels, but the prevailing view is caution and short-term downside.",
