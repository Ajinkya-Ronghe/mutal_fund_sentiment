    "explanation": "The BTC sentiment in the live chat is mixed but leans toward bullish for short-term and long-term. Multiple users mention strong buying pressure at resistance, expectations of new all-time highs in coming months, and positive macro factors like upcoming rate cuts and increased money inflow to crypto. However, there are also significant short calls, profit-taking, and warnings about liquidity grabs, indicating caution and frequent volatility. The consensus is to buy on pullbacks and hold for the next ATH, but with a watchful eye for short-term corrections.",
