    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term sentiment and volatility, the majority of live opinions reflect optimism about BTC's long-term prospects (e.g. potential for $1 million, ongoing bull cycle, market recovery after corrections). Several users mention successful trades, targets being hit, requests for new entries, and confidence in upward liquidity sweeps. Some mention booking profits, holding, or waiting for re-entry after price targets. There are cautionary and bearish voices, but bullish and constructive comments (liquidity to the upside, book profits, 1st targets hit, long-term bullishness) outweigh the negative. Multiple requests for BTC analysis and trade advice signal high interest and engagement. The market is volatile but overall sentiment and actionable talk indicate a strong buy signal with high confidence for experienced traders using risk management. Safe leverage for isolated perpetual futures is advised at 20x or less, per community best practices.",
