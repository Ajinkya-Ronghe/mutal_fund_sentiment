    "explanation": "The majority of live opinions indicate bullish momentum, with frequent mentions of pumps and expectations for BTC to move higher. Many traders are discussing long entries, targets above current levels (e.g., 109k, 110k+), and support at key levels (107k, 108k). There is positive sentiment around institutional signals (e.g., Fidelity comment), and traders are discussing strategies for long trades with some waiting for further confirmation. A few warn of short-term resistance or minor corrections, but the prevailing view is to buy or hold for more upside. Leverage discussions suggest aggressive risk-taking, with 20x being referenced as suitable for experienced traders.",
