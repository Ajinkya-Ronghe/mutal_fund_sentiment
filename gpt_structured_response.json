    "explanation": "Despite highly mixed sentiment and ongoing volatility, multiple representative comments indicate BTC is showing resilience at support levels, with many traders calling for 'buy', expecting a bounce or reversal from current levels, and discussing strong volume and liquidity near key zones. Although some warn of downside and 'dump', the crowd repeatedly requests BTC buy advice, and there are frequent confirmations that entry levels have hit and many are still holding long positions. The presence of bullish EMA crossovers on short timeframes and positive momentum mentions further support a high-confidence long/buy signal for BTC. The overall discussion highlights uncertainty but leans toward dip-buying and expecting recovery, especially after recent down moves, with several users reporting profits or ongoing long trades.",

What's important now is: if it breaks through and consolidates below this zone, it will most likely fly further - all the way to 106900 / 106400, there are good demand blocks and volumes there.",
