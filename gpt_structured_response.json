    "explanation": "Sentiment in the chat is mixed but has a notable downward bias: several participants mention major pullbacks to the 106kâ108k region, and multiple 'short' or 'sell' calls appear, including some specifying leverage. There are bullish opinions, but they are less frequent and less specific. No strong technical consensus, but crowd emotion leans negative in the short term.",
