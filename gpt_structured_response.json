    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions referencing BTC suggest a bullish outlook or expectation of price increases, such as references to 'subway pump,' 'going north,' and targets above 108-109k. Multiple users refer to strong support at 107k and expectations of a move to liquidate shorts above 109k. There are, however, a few bearish comments (e.g., head and shoulders, short to 107k), but the prevailing sentiment is upward with some neutral caution about stop losses.",
