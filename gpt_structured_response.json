    "explanation": "The majority of opinions and real-time chat reflect active interest in buying BTC on dips, mentioning key resistance levels (108000, 108500), bullish breakouts on higher timeframes (4hr), and expectations of further pumps or retests. However, there are also mentions of sharp value drops and some traders expressing lost hope or preferring shorts at local tops. Overall, positive and bullish momentum dominates, but there is visible volatility and pullback risk, so confidence is set to medium.",
