    "explanation": "There is high engagement regarding BTC with multiple mentions of upside potential, active trade discussions, and explicit long trade signals. Several users refer to BTC's dominance, price targets above 107k, and confirmation of uptrends. Marticlues AI issued a 'Long BTC/USDT' signal with clear entry/targets and a 'Bull Blast' technical analysis tag. Many chat participants discuss holding, re-entry, and expectations of upward movement, with very few expressing strong bearish conviction for the immediate term. The overall sentiment is positive, reinforced by algorithmic signals and crowd behavior.",
