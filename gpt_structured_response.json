    "explanation": "BTC is showing strong bullish sentiment across retail and influencer comments. Multiple users reference psychological and technical levels (108k, 105k, 110k, 118k), with several reporting successful long trades or holding long positions. Despite some noise about short scalps and local corrections, most opinions are bullish, referencing breakouts, new highs, and ATH (all-time high) targets. Several experienced traders suggest waiting for retest but remain bullish. The overall market is positioned for further upside, with some expecting a strong move post-news/events and positive macro sentiment (S&P at ATH, Powell's dovish remarks). Leverage discussion also shows preference for higher exposure, with some users comfortable with 20x or more, and even referencing 100x (not recommended, but indicates risk appetite). Negative opinions (drop, dump, short) are present but in the minority and often contradicted by others. Neutral opinions focus on waiting for signals or entry points, not active bearishness.",
