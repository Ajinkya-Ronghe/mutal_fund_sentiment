    "explanation": "Sentiment is mostly cautious to bearish in the short term. Several participants discuss key downside breakout levels (105200, 105350, 105000) and refer to failed support and trendline rejections. There is mention of bearish fractals and head-and-shoulders on higher timeframes, with some expecting a drop before a potential bounce. However, some opinions are neutral or indecisive, with references to possible bounces and no definitive selling pressure from holders. Therefore, a short-term sell signal is warranted with medium confidence, but market direction is not strongly one-sided.",
