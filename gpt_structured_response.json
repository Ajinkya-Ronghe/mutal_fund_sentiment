    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed but leans positive with many suggesting buying on trendline breaks, holding above key levels like 106,500, and some expecting a new all-time high or further upside. Some comments caution about volatility and possible local dips, but the majority see BTC as outperforming alts, with several asking if now is a good time to buy and others confirming active trades. Shorters and bears are present, but bulls are slightly more vocal especially around key levels and recoveries. Suggest isolated low leverage due to intraday volatility and mixed signals.",
