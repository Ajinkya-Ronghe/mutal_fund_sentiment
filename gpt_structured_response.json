    "explanation": "The sentiment is mixed but leans bearish in the short-term. There are repeated mentions of strong sell volume at key resistance (e.g., 108k), bear flags, warnings of big fluctuations, and several calls to short or expect a dump. Some traders are holding or waiting for lower levels to buy, while others mention failed breakouts and market traps. Risk warnings like 'don't get liquidated' are prevalent, and there is talk of possible further down moves before a recovery. However, a minority still mention holding or buying spot, and some expect a bounce at certain levels. Overall, the immediate 1-minute sentiment suggests caution and a likely short setup.",
