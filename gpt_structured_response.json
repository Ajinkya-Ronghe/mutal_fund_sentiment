    "explanation": "Despite significant volatility and mixed short-term sentiment, the aggregated opinions reflect strong bullish bias and high engagement on BTC, with repeated calls for dip buying, long entries at key supports, and positive sentiment tied to structural market events. Several traders note liquidity grabs and temporary bearish moves, but these are generally seen as opportunities to buy or go long rather than sustained downside. Consensus forms around BTC holding above critical levels (notably 104k and 106k), with multiple participants openly stating their intent to long at or after certain technical triggers (such as USDT.D retests or RSI confirmations). Leverage discussions suggest the appetite for high-risk trades remains robust, and there is little conviction behind sustained selling among influential participants. The overall tone is opportunistic bullish, with calls to buy dips and prepare for potential rallies.",
