    "explanation": "BTC has shown significant strength, overperforming other assets in the last 24 hours, and retaking key levels amid global macro relief (Iran-Israel ceasefire). Multiple traders report holding profitable long positions from 100k, trailing stop losses, and seeing order blocks and bullish structures around 108,642 and 107,250. There is consensus that breaking above 106,500 and holding could trigger further upside, with targets up to 108,500 and potentially 109,000. Bitcoin ETF inflows are robust, momentum is positive, and while some mention overbought RSI on daily, the weekly candle is strong and several traders remain bullish (some seeking entries on pullbacks). Negative opinions are mostly about high leverage risks and possible short-term corrections, but the prevailing sentiment is bullish with actionable long signals.",
