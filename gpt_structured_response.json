    "explanation": "Despite a significant mix of opinions (many calling for both short and long positions), there is persistent bullish sentiment, repeated mentions of institutional interest, and a consistent grind higher. Key resistance levels like 106,500 have been broken, and while many expect corrections or traps, the overall momentum and FOMO remain strong. There are also multiple confirmations of large investors accumulating and the market structure showing resilience, with short squeezes likely. Volatility is high, but current structure and sentiment support a long bias with safe, isolated leverage.",
