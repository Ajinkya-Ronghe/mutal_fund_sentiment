Marticlues AI explicitly calls for 'BTC/USDT Long Boom' and 'Long WBTC/USDT', indicating strong buy signals with target profits. Several users (MOON CAT, Kudjaks, JamTrades) express optimism about BTC's imminent rise ('moon', 'gonna moon', 'it gots to moon', 'might blow up'). There are no notable negative or short opinions on BTC, while one user (Was N 1) says 'dump it', but this is not specifically targeted at BTC and is outweighed by the positive signals.",
