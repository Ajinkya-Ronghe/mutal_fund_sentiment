    "explanation": "Despite a high number of bearish and indecisive comments (many participants discussing shorting, sell zones, and heavy volatility), there is mounting evidence of trapped sellers and a liquidity grab, which often precedes a strong upward move. Large buy orders and bullish liquidity events are being reported (e.g., $111M USD sent to Binance suggesting whale interest), and multiple voices indicate moves to 'trap' both buyers and sellers before a reversal. There are also repeated calls for entries on pullbacks, mentions of retail being shaken out, and fresh buy signals emerging from both technical and sentiment perspectives. The presence of news events (e.g., Powell comments, macro shifts) have created volatility but not reversed the overall bullish undercurrent, especially with spot buying highlighted and leverage not yet overheated. The recommended leverage is set to 20x isolated to balance risk and opportunity, as volatility is high but directional conviction is strong for a bounce or upward move from current levels.",
