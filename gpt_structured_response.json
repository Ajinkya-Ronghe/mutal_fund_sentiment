    "explanation": "The majority of opinions in the live chat lean bearish on BTC, with many participants explicitly calling for shorts, mentioning rejection at key levels (108.2k-109k), and expecting a downtrend after recent bounces. Some users warn of bull traps and heavy sell zones, while there are only a few scattered calls for 'buy' or 'hold'. The sentiment is reinforced by multiple users observing trapped longs, order blocks for selling, and a lack of strong bullish momentum. There are a few neutral and cautious 'wait for signal' comments. Although some users mention spot buying and macro shifts possibly supporting a bounce, the weight of real-time retail and trader sentiment is short-term bearish.",
