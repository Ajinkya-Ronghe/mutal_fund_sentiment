    "explanation": "The majority of recent live opinions indicate caution or bearishness for BTC in the short term. Several participants mention failed trendline retests, rejection at key resistances, possible double top on higher timeframes, and a general sentiment to 'wait' or look for shorts rather than initiating new longs. Some comments discuss the market trapping shorts, but most are hesitant to buy now due to recent strong upward movement and the possibility of a retracement. The 1-minute candlestick signal is considered short after confirmation of rejection and failure to break higher.",
