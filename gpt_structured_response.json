    "explanation": "The overall sentiment leans bullish with several comments mentioning bullish structure, potential for more upside, and targets above current levels. However, there is notable short-term uncertainty and mentions of both profit-taking and small pullbacks. Some traders are waiting for retests or confirmation, and there is mention of significant liquidity zones that could trigger volatility. The 1-minute candlestick signal is 'long' based on bullish momentum and inflow, but confidence is medium due to mixed short-term signals and warnings of possible shakeouts or corrections.",
