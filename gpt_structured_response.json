    "explanation": "The majority of recent comments reflect bullish sentiment for BTC, mentioning a potential for a major pump and new highs, references to strong buying activity, and optimism around upcoming macroeconomic events (e.g., rate cuts, favorable legislation). However, there are also notable warnings of volatility, potential liquidity sweeps, and some short-term bearish comments about pullbacks and retests, tempering overall confidence. The overall tone is optimistic but acknowledges risk and possible short-term corrections.",
