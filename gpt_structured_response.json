    "explanation": "The overall sentiment for BTC is cautious to bearish, with several participants signaling a need to wait for retracement, expecting a pullback, or warning against longing at current levels. There is mention of strong support zones for potential bounces, but the prevailing advice is to avoid new longs until a clearer retracement or signal emerges. Some bullish comments exist, but they are outnumbered by neutral to bearish caution.",
