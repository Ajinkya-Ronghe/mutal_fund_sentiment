    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is highly mixed but leans bullish overall. Many users report pullbacks being bought, targets set above current price (e.g., 108172, 109000), and some mention bullish technicals (bull season, money inflow, 4h/1h candles bullish). There are strong warnings about volatility and manipulations, and some users suggest waiting for corrections or highlight short-term pullbacks, but the majority expect higher prices and encourage buying on dips.",
