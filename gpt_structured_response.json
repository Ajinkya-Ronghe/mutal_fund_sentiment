    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Despite a mix of short and long calls, the overall sentiment leans bullish for BTC with several traders mentioning buying the dip, expecting pullbacks to be bought, and positive reactions to technical signals. Multiple users reported profits from longs, and several expect a bounce or continuation upward after minor corrections. Some mention the influence of macro news (Fed interest rate cuts) being positive, and technical levels showing support holding. Short-term volatility and shakeouts are noted, but most representative opinions favor accumulating or holding BTC at current or slightly lower levels. The confidence is high due to the majority of recent actionable trade ideas and the visible resilience in BTC price action.",
