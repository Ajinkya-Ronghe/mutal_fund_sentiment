    "explanation": "Despite mixed short-term sentiment and volatility, the majority of relevant, recent, and influential opinions point to imminent upside potential, consolidation, or strong support zones for BTC. Multiple participants noted buying interest, support at key levels (e.g., 107k, 106k), and expectations of new highs (ATH), while some mentioned liquidity hunting and parabolic moves. Alts are described as weak, with capital rotating into BTC. The consensus is that the larger trend remains bullish, especially while BTC holds above support and as liquidations trigger upside wicks.",
