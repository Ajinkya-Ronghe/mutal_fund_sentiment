    "explanation": "Several participants mention upward trends, support levels, and expectations for higher prices, such as targets of 120k and even talk of 1M. There is discussion of resistance near 108k-109k and the need for the daily close to remain bullish. The tone is cautiously optimistic with mentions of recent consolidation and the need to watch for big fluctuations in the coming weeks. Some concern exists about manipulation and false breakouts, but the consensus in the short term from candlestick and momentum views is to look for buying opportunities on support and confirmation of trend continuation.",
