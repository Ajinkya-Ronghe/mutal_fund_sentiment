    "explanation": "Despite some bearish commentary and ongoing volatility, a significant number of opinions suggest bullish setups, support holding, double bottom formations, and targets above current levels (e.g., 108,500). Multiple mentions of successful long trades, consolidation after a bounce, and bullish signals from influencers and bots (e.g., 'BTC/USDT Long Boom TP3!'). There are also concerns about sharp pullbacks and liquidation zones, but the overall sentiment for the immediate future leans bullish with high volatility. Caution is advised around key resistance levels, but a long bias is supported for active traders.",
