    "explanation": "There is a strong consensus among participants that BTC is showing bullish momentum, with multiple comments about BTC moving up, taking support, and price targets being set higher (e.g., 108500, 109100, 107921). Many are actively buying or holding BTC, some have sold alts to move into BTC, and notable participants mention institutional interest (e.g., Fidelity statement). While a few mention resistance and possible shorting at higher levels, the majority sentiment is for continued upside, especially after surviving macro events (Powell speech) and with visible demand in the chat. Short-term volatility is noted, but the overall signal is for an upward move with high confidence.",
