    "explanation": "BTC is the clear focus of the conversation, with repeated queries and confirmations about its trend, support, and entry points. Multiple participants expect further upside after minor retracements, referencing bullish scenarios (e.g. 'BTC upside hai', 'BTC 107200 pe aake waha se Again upside jaa sakta hai', 'BTC LONG ENTRY NOW', 'BTC me enter kr skte hai kya abhi?'). There's robust engagement around buy signals, holding through volatility, and discussions of recent losses being a setup for a reversal. Some concerns about drawdowns and short-term fakeouts are present, but the dominant sentiment is to buy or hold for higher targets. Representative opinions include advice to 'wait', encouragement for patience, and repeated confirmations that long entries are valid now.",
