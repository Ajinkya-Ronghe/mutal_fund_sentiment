    "explanation": "There is a visible split in sentiment, with several users discussing potential bullish patterns (e.g., Cup & Handle), support zones, and recommendations for long positions around the 107,200â107,400 range. Some warn of bear flags or suggest caution, but the majority lean toward taking long entries on dips and avoiding shorts. Multiple users requested new BTC trades and confirmations for entries, indicating ongoing interest in buying. Risk is noted due to volatility warnings and the potential for large moves, so leverage should be kept low.",
