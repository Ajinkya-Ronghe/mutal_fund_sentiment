    "explanation": "Despite mixed opinions, the overall sentiment in the live chat leans bullish for BTC. Multiple users mention targets above 108k and expectations of new all-time highs. There are recurring references to BTC breaking key resistance levels (106,500, 108,000, 108,400, 108,600), and several users claim to be holding or entering long positions. Some are scalping profits on the upside and expect further upward movement. Technical references such as bounces off the 50-day EMA and bullish patterns (cup and handle, W pattern) support the buy bias. While some traders are wary of potential dumps or shorting, the positive momentum and FOMO are evident, outweighing the negative and neutral views.",
