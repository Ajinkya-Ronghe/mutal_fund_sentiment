Some suggest a coming dump around the 101k-103k or 104.5k regions, and there's talk of too much long buying power and potential short squeezes, but a few also mention bullish setups or SFPs (stop hunt/fakeout). The majority lean negative for immediate action, but there is not overwhelming consensus for a full high-confidence short.",
