    "explanation": "The majority of recent live chat opinions reflect strong bullish sentiment for BTC, with multiple users discussing bullish breakouts, targets above 109k, and expectations of new all-time highs. Several viewers highlighted specific price targets (e.g., 112k, 118k), mentioned strong volume, referenced institutional accumulation zones (~70k), and noted that dips are viewed as buying opportunities. There are some short/neutral/dump comments, but these are outweighed by a higher number of bullish and FOMO-driven remarks, alongside explicit calls for fresh entries and longing BTC. The presence of positive momentum from key news events (Powell's speech, Trump, etc.) and the social atmosphere of anticipating higher prices all support a long bias. Leverage should be kept at a safe, conservative 20x given the volatility around news.",
