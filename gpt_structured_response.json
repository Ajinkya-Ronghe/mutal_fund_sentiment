    "explanation": "The majority of opinions are positive on BTC's near-term direction, with multiple users calling for buying, highlighting pump action, and referencing strong institutional support (e.g., Fidelity, ETF flows). There is evidence of current uptrend, recent bounce, and resilience after Powell's speech. Some users mention ideal entry points and minor pullbacks, but overall sentiment is bullish. Many discuss using leverage and perpetuals, and several are waiting for higher targets. The risk appetite is high, with multiple confirmations of active long trades and buy signals, including on the 1-minute chart.",
