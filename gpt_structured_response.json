    "explanation": "Despite considerable market volatility and mixed short-term sentiment, there are repeated mentions of BTC being at or near entry levels for swing trades and fresh upside opportunities (e.g., 'BTC is at entry level', '107320 par fresh entry banegi upside ke liye', 'look for longs and have a great day'). Several traders report taking profits or planning targets above current levels (e.g., 'BTC 108500 tak jaega', 'target asnar 108550'), and there is broad discussion about following the trend with buy signals. The short-term corrections and sell-offs are viewed by many as opportunities to enter long positions. The 1-minute candlestick and scalp signals (e.g., 'NEW BTC M1 CHART', '1 min kashe trade or confirmation le') reinforce momentum trading on the long side. The presence of trailing stop losses and active trade management also suggests bullish risk appetite. Negative comments exist but are outnumbered by long-side recommendations and positive trade reports.",
