    "explanation": "The majority of opinions indicate bullish sentiment for BTC, with many participants discussing targets above 108k, 109k, and even 113k-119k. Multiple users reported taking profits on the way up but planning to re-enter on dips, and several referenced technical factors like Fibonacci levels, daily EMA bounces, and strong upside momentum on higher timeframes (e.g., 'h4 pe super bullish'). While there are some concerns about minor pullbacks and local resistance, the overall tone is optimistic, with suggestions to hold, buy more on corrections, and expectations that BTC could reach new all-time highs. Short-term volatility is noted, but the consensus is for upward continuation.",
