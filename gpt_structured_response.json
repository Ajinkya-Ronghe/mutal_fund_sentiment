    "confidence": "High",
    "explanation": "Across the live chat, there is a strong bullish sentiment for BTC with many participants mentioning expected price increases (e.g., 'BTC 108500 tak jaega', 'btc upar bhag rha hai', 'btc up', 'Btc will go up'). There are also confirmations of active long trades and multiple users seeking long entries. Many negative views are directed at altcoins instead of BTC (e.g., 'Sell now Alts', 'Alts bottom'), and several users reference strong support and resistance holding for BTC. Technical mentions such as trendline grinding and bullish bounces reinforce the momentum. Scattered mentions of shorting only appear at higher levels, indicating most are waiting for further upside before considering shorts. Therefore, the consensus is a high-confidence buy/long signal for BTC, with significant crowd support and technical justification.",
