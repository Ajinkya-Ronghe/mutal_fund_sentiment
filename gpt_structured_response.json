Multiple participants mentioned selling BTC, setting stop-losses for shorts, or expecting BTC to fall to lower levels (e.g., 104k-106k). Some mention big fluctuations and volatility ahead. There are a handful of positive (buy-the-dip) and long-term bullish comments, but short-term sentiment leans bearish or cautious.",
