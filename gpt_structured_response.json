Some opinions express caution about recent rejection and fast moves, but the prevailing sentiment is bullish, with calls to 'buy the dips' and statements like 'BTC breakout hai', 'BTC to bhaag rha h', and 'Nice time to buy some BTC'. Macroeconomic references such as potential rate cuts also support risk-on assets like BTC.",
