    "explanation": "BTC is experiencing high volatility with a strong debate between bulls and bears. Opinions reflect a mix of short-term bearishness and medium-term bullish targets (such as 108,500 and 104,500), but there are repeated calls for long entries, strong support zones, and consolidation signals suggesting a near-term upward move. Several users mentioned buying zones near current levels and support at 107kâ108k, with some expecting a bounce and reversal. Market liquidity and equal long/short positioning indicate potential for a squeeze higher if new orders enter. The consensus leans toward taking long positions with high isolated leverage, but with an emphasis on risk management due to volatility.",
