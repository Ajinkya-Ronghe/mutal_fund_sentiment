    "explanation": "BTC is breaking key resistance levels (notably above 108k and 109k), with multiple participants noting strong upside momentum, new all-time highs, and successful breakouts. There is significant bullish sentiment, with several traders celebrating profits, calling for further upside, and observing that all resistance will soon be gone. While a few warnings about possible pullbacks and resistance zones exist, the majority of opinions express anticipation of higher prices, FOMO, and continued bullish structure. Short-term retracements are being bought aggressively, and there is frequent mention of large profits and strong trend continuation. Many are seeking re-entries after missed moves, further reinforcing the bullish bias. The consensus is to continue buying dips and maintain a bullish outlook.",
