    "explanation": "Several opinions note recent rejections at 1-minute and short-term timeframes, cautioning against longing until a retracement occurs. There are warnings about short traps and the risk of further downside or range-bound action. While some mention potential for new highs, the prevailing short-term sentiment is caution, with calls for patience and possible short entries after confirmation. The overall tone suggests waiting for clearer bullish signals before entering long trades.",
