    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bearish in the short term due to several participants noting possible drops below $100k, a current bear fractal, and head-and-shoulders pattern observations. Some technical traders suggest a likely retracement to as low as 103/104k or even 105,350 before a possible rebound higher, with caution advised. A few bullish views are present, but the prevailing tone is caution and expecting near-term downside or volatility.",
