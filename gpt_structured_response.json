    "explanation": "The sentiment among participants remains bullish, with repeated calls for BTC long entries, optimism about price targets (e.g., 106k, 107.5k, 137k), and multiple confirmations that BTC is expected to go up or continue an uptrend. Several users report holding or entering long trades, and algorithmic signals also recommend long positions with detailed entry/exit levels. While there are mentions of possible retracements, sideways action, or fakeouts, the majority opinion and technical signals favor an upside move. Leverage is discussed frequently, with users taking significant positions in BTC futures. Negative sentiment is minimal, with most doubts being about short-term volatility, not a trend reversal.",
