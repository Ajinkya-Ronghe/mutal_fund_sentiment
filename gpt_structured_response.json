    "explanation": "BTC opinions are highly mixed, but recent comments highlight downside risks, high liquidity trapping, imminent retests of lower levels (105k, 101k), and heavy liquidation clusters between 103kâ107k. Candlestick talk includes big red candles overpowering green and suggestions of bearish M-patterns and order block taps. However, there are also calls for long entries on breakouts and some optimism above 106.5k, indicating indecision and high volatility. The balance tips slightly toward short due to more frequent negative triggers and broader caution.",
