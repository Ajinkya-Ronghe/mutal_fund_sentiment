    "explanation": "Opinions are mixed overall, but several users mention BTC holding up, potential new highs, and references to bullish money flow and demand zones. Some see significant upside levels coming (e.g., 104k, 120k, 130k), while a few warn of possible drops or short entries. The overall sentiment from the live talk leans toward further upward momentum, though not with high conviction due to the presence of warnings and uncertainty about macro conditions.",
