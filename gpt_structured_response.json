    "explanation": "BTC remains the center of most discussions, with participants noting high volatility, repeated liquidity hunts, and significant price swings. Despite local short-term bearish moves, multiple users highlight that BTC is still in a long-term bull cycle, referencing cycles, halving, and institutional interest. Many express conviction that BTC will recover strongly after corrections, with several users discussing buy and hold strategies, and others advocating for long entries after liquidity sweeps. Repeated recommendations are given for buying dips and holding for higher future targets. While there is noise around short-term bearishness and some calls for local shorts, the overwhelming sentiment is positive, with more buy-side conviction apparent. High leverage trading is discussed, but there is consensus to use stop losses and respect risk management.",
