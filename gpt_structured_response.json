    "explanation": "Multiple live opinions indicate strong bullish sentiment and ongoing long positions in BTC, especially above key levels like 106,500 and 100k. Despite some short-term shorts and warnings about potential corrections, the majority of active traders are holding or entering long positions, trailing stop-losses, and expecting movement towards new highs (such as 108,500 and possibly higher). Recent market action includes a 6% weekly candle, breakouts above resistance, and momentum indicated by retail shorts getting squeezed. Technical comments regarding RSI and price action support a cautiously bullish outlook, with traders prepared for volatility but favoring upward continuation overall. Leverage is often discussed up to 75x, but a safe recommendation is 20x isolated for risk management.",
