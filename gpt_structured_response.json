    "explanation": "Despite the presence of both bullish and bearish short-term calls, the overall sentiment for BTC is positive, with multiple participants expecting upward momentum, large targets (108,500 and 109k), calls for long entries, and mentions of supply shocks and breakouts. Traders note BTC dominance is still high, suggesting alt season is not yet in full swing. The noise from short-term traders is outweighed by recurring references to holding or entering longs, anticipated breakouts, and positive price targets. Some volatility and whipsaws are expected, but the 1-minute signal and broader consensus suggest a high-confidence buy with a safe but assertive leverage profile.",
