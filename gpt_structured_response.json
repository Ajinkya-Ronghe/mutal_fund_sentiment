    "explanation": "Despite some bearish sentiment and calls for shorting around 107k-110k, the prevailing view among experienced traders and algorithmic signals is that BTC is in a strong uptrend with near-term resistance at 108500-109000 and potential for higher moves. Multiple participants reference buying pressure, limited BTC supply vs alts, and high-profile buy signals. There are also many confirmations of bullish structures, order block taps, and positive algorithmic calls for buying. Even in retracements, the consensus is a return to all-time highs is likely, with swings being opportunities to accumulate. Short-term volatility and news-driven pullbacks are present, but do not undermine the broader bullish bias.",
