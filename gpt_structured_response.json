    "explanation": "The majority of recent opinions express caution or bearishness about BTC's immediate prospects. Comments such as 'sell people', 'join waterfall now', and references to potential downward spikes or liquidity grabs suggest imminent pressure on the downside. Several users mention specific short levels (e.g., 108600) and express skepticism about a bullish move, while others note flat or ugly 1-minute candles and low volume, indicating a lack of upward momentum. There are some neutral or mixed signals, including suggestions to close scalp longs and uncertainty about shorting, but the prevailing sentiment leans bearish for the very short-term candlestick outlook.",
