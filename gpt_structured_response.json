Comments such as 'El Diablo LONGED it', 'come on bitty woooooo', and questions about longing suggest some participants are anticipating upward movement. However, warnings like 'Today is dump day be ready' indicate caution. No direct technical signals were mentioned for BTC, but the general tone leaned toward optimism with short-term uncertainty.",
