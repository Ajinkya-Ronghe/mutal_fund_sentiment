    "explanation": "Opinions are highly mixed with strong arguments for both buy and sell side, frequent mentions of sideways or choppy price action, and uncertainty about short-term direction. Some users mention bullish signals (e.g., 'BTC 108500 tak jaega', 'trend is respecting 15 min time I think bitcoin will go up to sell zone'), while others mention selling pressure, possible bear flag, and heavy sellers. The market appears to be consolidating with no clear consensus. Significant volatility expected in coming weeks.",
