Several participants warn about possible traps for longs, express skepticism on sustained upward moves, or discuss waiting for a retracement before entering new longs. There is some bullish sentiment, but the dominant short-term tone is neutral-to-bearish, favoring a short or wait-and-see approach for now.",
