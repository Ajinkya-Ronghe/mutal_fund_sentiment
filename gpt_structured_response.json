    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed but leans positive based on repeated calls to buy, discussions around key levels holding (107200, 106500), and references to uptrends and pumps. There is short-term uncertainty with some warnings about fake breakouts and possible drops, but more users are considering buying, holding, or expecting higher prices. The 1-minute chart is referenced positively. Leverage suggestions are generally moderate, and traders are wary of liquidation risks.",
