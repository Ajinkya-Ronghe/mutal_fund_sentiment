    "explanation": "There is a strong consensus on bullish momentum for BTC, with multiple users highlighting key levels above 106,500 as breakout targets and discussing potential runs to 108k, 109k, 111k, and even 113k+. Several comments mention recent successful long trades, bullish price action, and support from both technicals (flag/inverse FVG, breakouts) and broader sentiment. There are short-term pullback concerns, but the majority of talk indicates buying or holding is favored at current levels. Representative opinions suggest expectation of further upward movement after minor corrections, with some users specifically noting 1-minute and 15-minute bullish patterns.",
