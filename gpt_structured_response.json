    "explanation": "The sentiment is mixed but leans positive: multiple users discuss potential for bounce plays at key support levels (106.2k, 106.8k), with some specifically calling for 'long btc and sleep', and another noting price is not dropping as expected. A few warnings about possible further downside ('dump krwaado', 'btc ka') and uncertainty ('wait krlo', 'bada marenge') are present, but the majority of actionable recent opinions are biased toward expecting a bounce or holding long positions. This suggests a medium confidence 'Buy' recommendation for BTC on a 1-minute candlestick, with moderate leverage as some doubt remains.",
