    "explanation": "The majority of comments reflect a strong bullish sentiment for BTC, with repeated mentions of new highs, targets above 108k, and successful long trades. Several users reference technical setups, such as fib levels, EMA support, and price action confirming further upside. Some traders mention booking profits but plan to re-enter on pullbacks, and others indicate holding positions or adding to longs. While a few users discuss potential short-term pullbacks or corrections, the overall sentiment, especially among more confident voices, favors a continued uptrend. There are also references to external factors (e.g., Powell's speech, dollar weakness) supporting BTC's bullish movement.",
