    "explanation": "BTC sentiment is mixed but with a mild positive tilt. There are notable bullish opinions, including references to institutional accumulation (e.g., White House plan to buy BTC), users moving retirement funds into BTC, and multiple mentions of 'pump', 'to the moon', and 'buy' signals. Some technical comments highlight support at 106.5kâ107.5k and suggest a possible rebound if these levels are maintained. However, several traders mention consolidation, market manipulation, and low volume, indicating uncertainty. Short-term traders are split but there is no clear consensus for a strong short. The 1-minute candlestick signal is 'long' due to the prevalence of short-term bullish calls and expectation of a bounce, but overall conviction is only medium given significant caution and countering short opinions.",
