    "explanation": "BTC continues to show resilience and strong movement even as many altcoins are experiencing sharp dumps, and there is a notable presence of retail shorts being trapped. Multiple live chat users report successful or planned BTC long entries, and some mention the likelihood of a move to 108,500 or even higher. There is consensus that after a correction, BTC is ready for another upward move. News regarding the Federal Reserve allowing banks to conduct crypto activities is viewed as a positive macro development for BTC. Despite some volatility and attempts to induce fear, most BTC-focused comments remain bullish or highlight successful buy trades. The presence of strong buy signals on the 1-minute chart, combined with community sentiment and trading activity, supports a high-confidence long (buy) recommendation with leverage.",
