There is mention of BTC overperforming everything in the last 24 hours, strong ETF inflows, market relief over geopolitical events, and several direct buy/long recommendations. Some anticipate short-term sideways or retracement, but the majority sentiment is bullish with expectations for higher prices. Liquidation data and large pending orders at key levels are being monitored, and sentiment is supported by positive macro and technical signals.",
