    "explanation": "The majority of opinions and sentiment are bullish on BTC. There are repeated calls to 'buy the dip', 'longs for scalps', and expectations of new all-time highs if key resistance levels are broken. Several comments note correlation with bullish tech stocks and positive technical signals such as bullish stochastic and uptrend confirmation. While some caution about short-term pullbacks and manipulation, most users express optimism for further upside, with some mentioning targets above 106,500 and even 110,000. Few negative or neutral takes are present, and there is a focus on holding or entering longs, with high leverage (20x isolate future perpetual) discussed as reasonable by the community.",
