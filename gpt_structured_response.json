    "explanation": "Despite a split in sentiment with significant short and long calls, the dominant mood is bullish with frequent references to new all-time highs, long-term holds, and expectations for further upside. Many users are entering or holding long positions, referencing key breakout levels (e.g., above 106,500 and 108,000), and anticipating bullish continuation if weekly closes remain strong. Notable remarks highlight accumulation, anticipation of a 'squeeze' on shorts, and major traders calling for higher targets. While some are shorting or expressing caution about volatility, most influential and frequent opinions lean toward buying and holding, expecting bullish momentum to continue.",
