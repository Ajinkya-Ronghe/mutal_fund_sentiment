    "explanation": "While there are notable short-term concerns about selling pressure and resistance near 108k-109k, the majority of the community opinions remain bullish mid-term, pointing to strong buying on dips, expectations of new all-time highs, and significant future growth. There is, however, visible caution due to chart divergences and resistance levels. The consensus leans bullish but not with full conviction due to these mixed signals.",
