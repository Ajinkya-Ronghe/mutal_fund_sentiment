    "explanation": "The sentiment around BTC is mixed but leans slightly negative in the short term. There are mentions of BTC losing the 108k level and warnings about smart money selling while less experienced traders buy. Some users reference critical support levels (935, 900), implying possible further downside if those are lost. However, there are also calls to buy and some neutral or hopeful statements about the next days, but the immediate mood is cautious to bearish.",
