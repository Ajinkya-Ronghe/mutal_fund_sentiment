    "explanation": "Despite some short-term volatility, the majority of opinions suggest ongoing bullish momentum for BTC, driven by positive correlation with strong stock market performance (especially NASDAQ hitting new ATH), technical indicators showing sustained uptrend on multiple timeframes, and sentiment about upside targets up to 108k and beyond. Long entries are favored over shorts, with several users confirming strong support levels, anticipation of new highs, and discussions about holding long positions. There is also mention of 4h and daily stochastic indicators entering bullish zones, and the need to break and hold above $106,500 for further upside. Short-term dips and liquidity sweeps are possible, but the prevailing bias is upward, supported by both technicals and macro sentiment.",
