    "explanation": "Despite considerable short-term bearish sentiment and conflicting intraday calls, there is a persistent undercurrent of bullish long-term conviction. Multiple opinions suggest current dips are opportunities, referencing historical all-time highs (ATH) as likely to be revisited soon. Market participants mention strong liquidity below, potential recovery to higher targets, and algorithmic buy signals at current levels. Numerous users are actively seeking long entries, with some noting that BTC tends to lead the crypto market, and any breakdown is met with buying interest. Several references to 107k being a buying or reversal zone, and others indicate patience will pay off as volatility is expected to increase. The majority of fast scalping or short-term traders are split, but the overall expectation from the broader sentiment is for a return to the upside, especially after current corrections and volatility. Leverage should remain moderate to high for experienced traders due to volatility.",
