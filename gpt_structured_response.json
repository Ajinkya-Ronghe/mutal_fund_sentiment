    "explanation": "A significant number of participants express a bearish or sideways view for BTC in the immediate term. There are repeated calls for shorting, mentions of the price heading down to 100k, references to triple tops, and general uncertainty or SL hunting. While a few voices mention upside potential, the majority are concerned about further downside or market traps. The 1-minute candlestick signal leans short due to this negative sentiment, but overall confidence is medium as a few opinions still expect bounces or mixed volatility.",
