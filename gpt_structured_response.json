    "explanation": "Several participants expect higher BTC prices (targets mentioned above 107k, 109.6k, even 111k), and some reference technical confluences like VWAP and Ichimoku cloud supporting upward movement. However, there is some caution with mentions of required support retests and a few short/uncertain signals, so the overall confidence is medium rather than high.",
