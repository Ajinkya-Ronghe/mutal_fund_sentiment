    "explanation": "Multiple users express a positive outlook on BTC, citing retest completions, expectations for upward movement, and bullish candlestick signals on the 1-minute timeframe (e.g., users mentioning 'BTC upar jaane ke liye taiyar hai', 'retest complete now going up', and 'we long only'). Several comments reference potential breakouts and buying dips, while some warn of traps or recommend caution due to market volatility or liquidity sweeps. There are scattered suggestions to short, but the majority of actionable opinions and price commentary are skewed toward a long/buy bias. The presence of sideways and risk management mentions tempers the conviction slightly.",
