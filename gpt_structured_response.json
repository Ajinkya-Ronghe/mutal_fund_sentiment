    "explanation": "Multiple participants voiced concerns about BTC's upside being limited (e.g., 'BTC kitna High laga sakta hai', '107.8?', 'Molyn Brefon: 107.86 max i can see'), and there were several calls to short near 110,000 ('SalmanDÂ£vil: Bhai please batao 110000 bhai yanha se short kar sakta hu ???', 'Ferhaan Schmidt: now is good short'). Several users also referenced the presence of bears and market weakness ('GRIMMS: bears are roaming freely', 'GRIMMS: the beg for blood', 'oscartg638: i hate to say it but price must retest new support again'). Although some mentioned an uptrend if BTC stays above 107.3, the overall sentiment in recent opinions leans towards caution and shorting at resistance levels.",
