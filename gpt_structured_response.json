    "explanation": "The majority of opinions, despite some bearish and consolidation remarks, lean towards bullish targets (mentions of 89k, 95k, 99-101k, 104.5k, 107.8k, 108k, 109k). Many traders are looking for long entries, holding longs, or suggesting to buy more BTC. Several call for a reversal or a V-shape recovery, and sentiments on fakeouts and downside are balanced by a strong support narrative and talk of upward targets. The crowd shows high engagement around upward breakouts and support holding, with multiple confirmations of ongoing or potential bullish moves. High leverage and FOMO are also present, suggesting strong retail interest in more upside.",
