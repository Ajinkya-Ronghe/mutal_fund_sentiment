    "explanation": "Sentiment is mixed but leans bullish overall. Several participants mention accumulation, strong support levels, and government or institutional buying. Some warn of volatility, manipulation, and the need for confirmation at key levels (e.g., 107k, 106.5k). There are many calls to buy dips, DCA strategies, and references to bullish momentum, but the presence of bear flag warnings, sideways/chop comments, and suggestions to wait for daily closes indicate caution. No clear consensus on extreme leverage; moderate leverage is safest given volatility.",
