    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions point to bullish sentiment for BTC, with repeated mentions of a bull run, calls to 'pump it up', and references to BTC and gold reaching new all-time highs. There is excitement and positive momentum, despite a few warnings about possible divergence and short-term caution. The overall sentiment, especially on short timeframes and recent candlesticks, is clearly upward. BTC dominance is noted as dropping, which could indicate rotation to alts, but the explicit BTC commentary is bullish.",
