    "explanation": "The majority of recent user sentiment in the live chat is bullish on BTC. Many users are either in long positions, looking for new long entries, or discussing targets above current levels (e.g., 108500, 109000, even higher). Several mention missed opportunities on the buy side, holding BTC, or booking partial profits but remaining optimistic. Concerns about short-term volatility and stop-loss hunts exist, but the prevailing attitude is to buy the dip or hold positions. Technical comments reference bullish engulfing candles, supply zone breakouts, and anticipated moves to all-time highs after retests. Very few are advocating strong shorts, and even those discuss them as brief or scalp opportunities.",
