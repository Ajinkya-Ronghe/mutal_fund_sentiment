    "explanation": "Despite significant short-term volatility with both positive and negative sentiment, there is a notable bias toward upward continuation after key technical levels (e.g., $106,500) are broken and held. Several users reported entering or holding longs, referencing FOMO (fear of missing out), and positive price action after consolidations. The presence of institutional buying rumors and discussions about retail traders opening more shorts suggest a potential for a short squeeze. Notably, some experienced traders mention waiting for confirmation on higher timeframes (weekly closes above ATH), which also adds to the bullish conviction. The candlestick signal is supported by calls to buy, traders booking profits on longs, and technical level confirmations.",
