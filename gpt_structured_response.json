    "explanation": "Despite some mixed opinions and warnings of volatility, the majority of direct BTC commentary and crowd sentiment support bullish action. Several users note buy signals, anticipation of a pump to higher targets such as 110k and 123k, and the view that institutional and retail interest remains strong. Some traders are holding long positions, referencing support zones and stating that current dips are buying opportunities, while a few mention using USDT dominance as an inverse indicator for BTC entries. Dips are widely regarded as opportunities to accumulate, and even bearish voices discuss only temporary pullbacks before further upside. The overall consensus is to buy on dips, with high leverage being called out by some for experienced traders.",
