    "explanation": "The majority of live chat opinions are positively biased towards BTC with many discussing long entries, holding longs, and anticipating further upside. Several users mention targets above current prices (109k, 112k, 115k), references to breaking out or heading towards all-time highs, and bullish confirmation from chart structures and BTC dominance. While some express caution about possible downside or losses from stop-loss hits, the overwhelming sentiment is that the current pullbacks are buy opportunities and the trend remains bullish. Leverage discussions suggest aggressive positions but for safety, a 20x isolated perpetual is recommended.",
