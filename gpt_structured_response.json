    "explanation": "Despite significant short-term bearish sentiment and volatility, the majority of higher time frame opinions and market structure discussions remain bullish on BTC. There is a strong narrative of institutional accumulation, breakout potential above key resistance levels, and positive market momentum. Even with many traders shorting or expecting dumps, the persistent grind higher, FOMO, and repeated references to bullish higher time frames and potential for new highs support a long bias. Notably, traders are watching for breakouts and dips as buying opportunities, and the overarching sentiment is that any dips are likely to be bought quickly, with significant upside targets mentioned (e.g., 110k, 117k, and even 120k).",
